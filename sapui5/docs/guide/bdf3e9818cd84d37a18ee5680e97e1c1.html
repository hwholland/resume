	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Event handler methods are invoked when an event occurs. Method names starting with
			<samp class="ph codeph">on</samp> are reserved for event handler methods.</p>

		<p class="p">For common events, such as <samp class="ph codeph">click</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">keydown</samp>, it is sufficient
			to add a handler method. As <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> core automatically registers browser event handlers
			for these methods, they are called automatically. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> core also fires events with a
			richer semantic meaning, so that control developers do not need to check so many
			keycodes, and so on.</p>

		<p class="p">These events are defined in <samp class="ph codeph">jquery.sap.events.js</samp> and their names start
			with "sap". An example is the <samp class="ph codeph">sapnext</samp> event, which is triggered by
			"arrow down" or "arrow right" (or "arrow left" in right-to-left mode). The
				<samp class="ph codeph">sapnext</samp> event performs all checks that are required to check
			whether the user wants to navigate to the next item. The <samp class="ph codeph">evt</samp> object
			that is passed to the handler method contains more information. These methods are
			private methods and must only be called by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> core.</p>

		<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
onclick: function(evt) {

     alert("Control " + this.getId() + " was clicked.");

  },



  onsapnext: function(evt) {

     // navigate to next item, an arrow key was pressed

     ...

  }</pre></div>
