	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using an OData Service to Load Data to the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> Repository</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use the OData service <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/APAB_REPOSITORY_SRV</samp> to upload a
			<span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> app, component, or
		library to the SAPUI5 repository. </p>

		<p class="p">If you use a repository, for example git, and a build server, for example Jenkins, for the
			central coordination of your <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> developments, you can use
			the OData service <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/APAB_REPOSITORY_SRV</samp> to upload the respective
			files that are collected in a zip file to the SAPUI5 repository. The OData service
			uploads the zip file to the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP into a BSP application that is created
			or updated during the uplaod. This BSP application represents the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> repository. From there,
			the app, for example, can be used in the SAP Fiori launchpad. The OData service
				<samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/APAB_REPOSITORY_SRV</samp> uses the SAP Gateway service builder
			project  <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/ABAP_REPOSITORY</samp>.</p>

		<p class="p">The OData service offers the basic entity <samp class="ph codeph">Repository</samp> and supports
				<samp class="ph codeph">GET</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">CREATE</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">UPDATE</samp>, and
				<samp class="ph codeph">DELETE</samp> operations. On return, the HTTP status reports either
			success or errors which may have occurred during the operation. The response header or
			the response body contain additional information.</p>

		<p class="p">The base64-encoded zip archive that contains the app, component, or library files is
			provided in the <samp class="ph codeph">ZipArchive</samp> property. The operations
				<samp class="ph codeph">CREATE</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">UPDATE</samp> use the file provided in the
			property for the operation. You use the <samp class="ph codeph">GET</samp> method of the OData service
			to retrieve a basic XML form that you can use for the <samp class="ph codeph">CREATE</samp> and
				<samp class="ph codeph">UPDATE</samp> operations. To remove a SAPUI5 repository, you use the
				<samp class="ph codeph">DELETE</samp> method that, if successful, deleted the corresponding BSP
			application and its SICF service and updates the SAPUI5 application index.</p>

		<p class="p">The following URL parameters are provided for the communication of mandatory or optional
			parameters for the operations that are not part of the <samp class="ph codeph">Repository</samp>
			entity itself:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loioa883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8__ul_llz_pwd_scb">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">CodePage</samp>: Contains the information about the code page of your
					text files, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">CodePage='UTF8'</samp></p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">TestMode</samp>: If set to <samp class="ph codeph">TRUE</samp>, the operation runs as a test and
					no upload takes place.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">TransportRequest</samp>: Specifies an ABAP transport request</p>

			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">If you upload a zip archive containing a SAPUI5 app, component, or library into the SAP
			NetWeaver AS ABAP for deployment or for delivery, a SAPUI5 repository is created or
			updated and the Business Add-In (BAdI) <span class="ph uicontrol">SAPUI5 Repository Load</span>
				(<samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/BADI_REPOSITORY_LOAD</samp>) is called. You need to implement this
			BAdI on the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP and use it to check and adjust the parameters that
			control the OData service, for example, if you want to determine or create an ABAP
			transport request automatically. For more information about the Business Add-In, see the
			BAdI documentation in the SAP system.</p>

		<p class="p">To further control the upload operation of the OData service, you can use the following
			text files in the archive:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loioa883327a82ef4cc792f3c1e7b7a48de8__ul_drl_112_scb">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">'.Ui5RepositoryIgnore'</samp>: Each line in this text file describes a file pattern
					that indicates which files shall be ignored during the upload. The line contains
					a substring of the file path or a regular expression starting with '^' and
					ending with '$'. This setting overwrites the build-in default.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">'.Ui5RepositoryTextFiles'</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">'.Ui5RepositoryBinaryFiles'</samp>:
					These text files are used to identify text and binary content in addition to the
					build-in default. If it is not clear whether a file is text or binary, a warning
					is issued in the log and the file is not uploaded.</p>

			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">For testing the OData service, you can use the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP with the SAP Gateway
			client (transaction <samp class="ph codeph">/IWFND/GW_CLIENT</samp>).</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> For operations on a SAPUI5 repository, you need the <samp class="ph codeph">S_DEVELOP</samp>
			authorization.</div>
