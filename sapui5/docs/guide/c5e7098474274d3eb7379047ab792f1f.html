		components, and libraries in the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository and related to
		components and libraries in the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> distribution
		layer.</p>

		<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
			<p class="p">The index is used by several different services such as the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span> and cache
				buster. This means you have to make sure that the index is updated using the
				calculation report whenever the content of the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository has
				changed. For more information whether the report is executed automatically or you
				have to run it manually, see <a class="xref" href="fbce0ba7a31f4073959efd705924af45.html" title="Changes to the content of the SAPUI5 ABAP repository require the index to be updated using the calculation report /UI5/APP_INDEX_CALCULATE. Depending on how the content of the repository is changed, the report is executed automatically or you have to run it manually.">Calculation Report - Automatic Run vs. Manual Scheduling</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">Also descriptor and component IDs used in single <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> repositories have to
				be unique and valid. Fore more information, see <a class="xref" href="3dd37367d73945bcae39301e12a4eee4.html" title="Component IDs used in single repositories have to be unique and valid. Using the ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC), you can check if they are.">Component IDs - Are They Unique and Valid?</a>.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">The index makes it possible to retrieve and find this information significantly faster
			than when carrying out the calculations each time it's requested. The index is also
			required, for example, for finding the paths to SAP Fiori libraries.</p>

		<div class="p">The index contains the following:<ul class="ul" id="loioc5e7098474274d3eb7379047ab792f1f__ul_sgq_lb2_1t">

					<p class="p">Certain properties or attributes (for example, component ID, used library, or
