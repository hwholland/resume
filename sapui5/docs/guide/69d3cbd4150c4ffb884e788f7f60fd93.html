		<p class="p">In <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>, the mock server mimics OData backend calls. It simulates the OData provider and is
			completely client-based, meaning that no network connectivity to a remote host is
			required. It intercepts HTTP calls made to the server and provides a fake output to the
			client. All this is transparent to data binding and use of OData model and feels like a
			real server. No changes are required on the OData model.</p>

		<p class="p">The mock server provides mock services and also mock data. It supports randomly generated data
			based on the service metadata, as well as mock data provided in JSON files.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">Mock Server only supports the JSON format for representing the resources it exposes,
				such as collections, entries, links, and so on.</p>
