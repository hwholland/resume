			<p class="p">Rules can check different aspects of an app depending on the desired result. Each rule belongs
				to a specific ruleset. The ruleset is a JavaScript file named
					<samp class="ph codeph">library.support.js</samp> that defines a set of rules. It consists of
				all the rules for an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> library. Before
				creating a rule, you first need to create the ruleset. You can only have one ruleset
				per library.</p>

			<p class="p">The next subsections contain more detailed information on how to create new rules and test
				them. You can also see examples of best practices and common types of rules.</p>
