		<p class="p">To get a preview of how your configuration looks at runtime, you can execute it using the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Execute</span> button on the footer of the APF Configuration
			Modeler. The configuration is launched in a separate browser window so that you can see
			the configuration and the corresponding runtime application side by side.</p>

		<p class="p">The configuration preview is generated using the generic APF runtime application. Since
			the generic APF runtime application does not support filters that use a function to
			determine the values, there is a restriction in previewing those filters: They are shown
			in the preview with all values selected by default, but it is not possible to select
			other values.</p>

		<p class="p">If a request in your configuration requires parameters or mandatory filters that will be
			handed over by another application in a productive system, for example, by a Smart
			Business KPI tile, the preview will not work properly. To simulate that the required
			parameters are handed over to the app, you can configure hidden filters and put them in
			front of all other filters. This ensures that the preview shows the correct data and you
			can test your application. The hidden filters do not show up on the runtime user
			interface. If a context value is handed over from outside at a later stage, this context
			value will take precedence over the default value in the configuration of the hidden
			filter, so you do not even have to remove the hidden filter. </p>
