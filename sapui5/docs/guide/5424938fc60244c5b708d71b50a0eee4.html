	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">As a fallback mechanism for translating apps, you can use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository for storing
		the target texts.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">What's the recommended translation approach?</div><div type="What's the recommended translation approach?">
			
			<p class="p">The recommended translation approach is to store your target texts in properties files
				(resource bundles), a <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;identifier&gt;_&lt;locale&gt;.properties</samp>
				file for every language the app is translated to (&lt;locale&gt; containing the
				language and an optional country code). For example,
					<samp class="ph codeph">i18n_en_US.properties</samp> would contain the American English texts
				of the <samp class="ph codeph">i18n.properties</samp> source file. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="91f225ce6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="A resource bundle file is a Java properties file (as described in the Javadoc of class java.util.Properties). It contains key-value pairs where the values are the language-dependent texts and the keys are language-independent and used by the application to identify and access the corresponding values.">Resource Bundles</a>.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">When can I use the SAPUI5 text repository?</div><div type="When can I use the SAPUI5 text repository?">
			
			<p class="p">You can use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text
				repository as a fallback if you cannot use the recommended approach. Please only use
				it in this case.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">What's the fallback all about?</div><div type="What's the fallback all about?">
			
			<p class="p">When you use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text
				repository, the source texts are stored in the default properties file
					<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;identifier&gt;.properties</samp> (that is, there are not <em class="ph i">n</em>
				properties files as with the recommended approach). The <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository writes
				the texts that are stored in the default properties file to a language-dependent
				database table. As usual, the texts can then be translated using transaction
					<samp class="ph codeph">SE63</samp> (usually in a separate system). The master language of the
					<span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository
				is taken as the master language for the submitted texts. Once the translated texts
				are transported back to the respective systems, they can be accessed at runtime when
				texts in a certain language are requested.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">What do I have to do to use the SAPUI5 text repository?</div><div type="What do I have to do to use the SAPUI5 text repository?">
			
			<p class="p">You have to set up the default properties file in a special way by adding the following key as
				the first line in the properties file with texts that you submit to the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP repository:</p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph"># SAPUI5 TRANSLATION-KEY &lt;GUID with 32 characters&gt;</samp></p>

			<p class="p">You can create the GUID with the ABAP function module <samp class="ph codeph">GUID_CREATE</samp>,
				or you can create the complete line with the ABAP report
					<samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/TEXT_FILE_GEN_TRANS_KEY</samp>. (A UUID as used in Java is also
				supported.)</p>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">The GUID serves as a unique identifier for the properties file. Never change the
					GUID or copy it to other properties files.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">The properties file has to fulfill the following rules:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loio5424938fc60244c5b708d71b50a0eee4__ul_ylr_sss_xw">
					<li class="li">It doesn't contain any duplicate text elements.</li>

					<li class="li">The text must be on one line and can have a maximum of 255 characters.</li>

					<li class="li">A text type is assigned to every text element.</li>

				</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">Accidental overwriting of texts in the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository with
				texts from other properties files is prevented. If a duplicate GUID is detected, the
				properties files cannot be synchronized. It's not possible to rename or relocate a
				properties file and to submit it once it's contained in the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text repository.
				Before you can rename or relocate a properties file, you have to remove the texts
				from the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> text
				repository by using the report <samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/TEXT_ENTRIES_DELETE</samp>.</p>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">If you run this report, all translated texts get lost. Therefore, only use it for
					texts that are not yet translated.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">After running the report, submit the renamed or relocated properties file again.</p>

			<p class="p">If you reassign the BSP application on the ABAP server (representing a single <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> repository) from a
				local (<samp class="ph codeph">$TMP</samp>) package to a non-local package, you also need to
				resubmit the properties file. All text elements are generated again with the new
				creation time stamp.</p>

			<div class="p">
				<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">Since the master language of the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> ABAP
						repository serves as the master language of the texts, it's important that
						you use the same language for the creation of the repository that was used
						for the properties files. When you use the <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> repository
						team provider and create the BSP application manually, you have to choose
						the correct language on the logon screen.</p>
