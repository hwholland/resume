	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Master-Detail app implements a busy indication concept as specified by the SAP
		Fiori Design Guidelines.</p>

		<div class="p">Calling the app will result in the following:<ul class="ul" id="loioa92e0aa0d121436885a96e420b26b945__ul_vxk_wc1_bt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Only initially a global busy indicator is displayed that overlays the whole
						app until the metadata of the service is loaded.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Afterwards, a local busy indicator is displayed on the master list and the
						detail page.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">When the detail page is loaded, the line item table on the detail page is set
						to busy until the line items are loaded with a separate service call.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">When controls are loading additional data or getting refreshed, a local busy
						indication is displayed automatically.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
</div>

		<p class="p">By default, the busy indicator delay is set to one second for all controls. This would
			first show the UI for a second, then show a busy indication until the data is loaded. To
			avoid this behavior initially and show the busy indicator immediately without delay, the
			following concept is implemented in the app: The <samp class="ph codeph">busyIndicatorDelay</samp> and
				<samp class="ph codeph">busy</samp> properties of certain controls (<samp class="ph codeph">AppView</samp>,
				<samp class="ph codeph">List</samp> on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Master</span> page,
				<samp class="ph codeph">DetailPage</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">Table</samp> on the
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Detail</span> page) are bound to the local view model and
			manipulated in the controllers of the app. The delay is initially set to "0" for
			displaying the busy indicator immediately, and reset to the previous value after the
			initial loading is done.</p>

		<p class="p">You can simulate server delays to test this implementation running with mocked
			application data by using the URL parameter <samp class="ph codeph">serverDelay=true</samp> in the
			hash. The default is set to 1000ms.</p>
