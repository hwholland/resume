	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Components are independent and reusable parts used in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>
		applications.</p>

		<p class="p">An application can use components from different locations from where the application is running. Thus, components can be developed by different
			development teams and be used in different projects. Components also support the encapsulation of closely related parts of an application into a
			particular component. This makes the structure of an application and its code easier to understand and to maintain.</p>

		<div class="p">
			<div class="note note" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__note_N1001B_N10018_N10011_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Constraints due to cross-origin issues also apply to components.</div>

		</div>

		<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> provides the following two types of components:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__ul_dt4_hyw_4k">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Faceless components (class: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Component</samp>)</p>

				<p class="p">Faceless components do <strong class="ph b">not</strong> have a user interface and are used, for example, for a service that delivers data from a back-end
					system.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">UI components (class: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp>)</p>

				<p class="p">UI components extend components and add rendering functionality to the component. They represent a screen area or element on the user
					interface, for example, a button or a shell, along with the respective settings and metadata. <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp>
					extends <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Component</samp> and adds rendering functionality to the component.</p>

			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Component</samp> class is the base class for UI and faceless components and provides the metadata for both types of
			components. To extend the functionality, components can inherit from their base class or from another component.</p>

		<p class="p">Components are loaded and created via the component factory function <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.component</samp>. You can either pass the name of the component
			or the URL of the descriptor file (<span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span>) to load it via the descriptor, see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html#loiobe0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da__manifirst">Manifest First Function</a>. We recommend loading the component using the descriptor
			(if available) - it improves performance during the initial load since the loading process can be parallelized and optimized.</p>

		<p class="p">After loading the descriptor, the component factory can load the dependencies (<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>
			libraries and other dependent components) in parallel next to the component preload, and also models can be preloaded.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__section_N10059_N10011_N10001"><div class="section_title">Structure of a Component</div><div type="Structure of a Component"><p class="p">A component is organized in a unique namespace, the namespace of
				the component equals the component name.</p>
<div class="p">Basically, a component consists of the component controller (<span class="ph filepath">Component.js</span>)
				and a descriptor (<span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span>). Only the component controller is mandatory, but we recommend to also use the descriptor
				file. The descriptor then contains the component metadata, and also expresses the component dependencies and configuration (see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>). All required and optional resources of the component have to be organized in the namespace
				of the component.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">Optional resources are, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">CSS</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">js</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">i18n</samp> files, views, controllers)</p>

			<p class="p">The following list explains how other concepts used in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> are distinguished from
				the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> components concept:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0__ul_xc4_nfl_kn">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Composite controls</p>

					<p class="p">Both concepts provide a set of controls behind a single interface. Composite controls are intended for reuse within control development
						and allow to include existing controls in a complex control whereas components are intended for reuse in application development.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">UI library</p>

					<p class="p">The UI library is the deployable unit around controls: Controls are never deployed standalone, but as part of a control library.
						Components, however, are self-contained and should <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> be used to deploy controls.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Notepad control</p>

					<p class="p">A notepad control is another way to define a control. Notepad controls have all the characteristics of a control.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">MVC</p>

					<p class="p">The MVC concept allows to define views and controllers and, thus, to structure and reuse parts within an application. As MVC can only be
						deployed separately and has no means to define dependent styles or scripts that are loaded together with a view, this concept is of
						limited use across different applications.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li"><p class="p">Application</p>
Applications have a single start URL and contain everything belonging to the application in a deployable unit. However, it
					is <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> possible to embed an application into another application as the knowledge about the required libraries, scripts
					and additional style sheets is contained in the index.html.</li>
