	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can create own content for <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>. To develop controls in
		JavaScript, you can either extend existing controls or create new ones.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> If you want to contribute to <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>, you have to
			consider our guidelines and recommendations with regard to, for example, product
			standards, file names and encoding.</div>

		<p class="p">As a control developer, you create or modify UI libraries and their pieces, i.e. controls and types. You define the set of properties your control
			provides as well as events or aggregations. A major task is the implementation of a control-specific renderer, which knows how to create suitable
			HTML markup for a given control instance, taking its current state into account. A renderer is written in JavaScript and produces HTML output which
			is styled by means of CSS. Such style sheets are another important part of a UI library.</p>

		<p class="p">Controls can be defined on the fly without a library definition or running generation
			steps. These controls are also called <dfn class="term">notepad controls</dfn>.</p>

		<p class="p">When you want to develop several controls for reuse in different applications, we
			recommend creating a control library instead of using these notepad controls. Control
			libraries have additional features such as automatic support for theming and
			right-to-left languages, but the implementation of the controls is the same as for
			notepad controls.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">This functionality is not restricted to controls. It can also be used to create or
				extend arbitrary objects, such as components, that are derived from
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.base.ManagedObject</samp>. <span class="ph">For more
					information, see <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.html" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.html" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.html">API Reference:
