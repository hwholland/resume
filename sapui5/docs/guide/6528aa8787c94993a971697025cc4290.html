		<p class="p">To change the configuration of an APF-based application that was shipped by SAP, you must
			first import the corresponding JSON file as well as the text properties file into the
			APF Configuration Modeler. The options that are available for importing files depend on
			whether you use SAP Business Suite powered by SAP HANA or <span class="ph pname">SAP S/4HANA</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">The files to be imported can either result from a configuration export or you can
				copy them from a shipped BSP application.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Configuration files of APF-based applications that were not created using the APF
				Configuration Modeler cannot be imported. You can easily recognize these
				configuration files because they do not contain a configuration GUID.</div>

			<p class="p">To import the files, proceed as follows: </p>

			<ol class="ol" id="loio6528aa8787c94993a971697025cc4290__ol_k4v_4c4_kq">
				<li class="li">On the footer toolbar of the <span class="ph uicontrol">Application Overview</span> screen,
					click <span class="ph uicontrol">Import</span>.</li>

				<li class="li">Choose a configuration file for upload. The file must be in JSON format.</li>

				<li class="li">Choose a text properties file for upload. The file must be in .properties
					format. It is also possible to upload a text properties file only, for example,
					after translation or to switch the development language.</li>

				<li class="li">Click <span class="ph uicontrol">Upload</span>.</li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p">During import, the content of the configuration file is written into a configuration
				table. The content of the text properties file is written into a text table.</p>

			<p class="p">If the application with the GUID specified in the JSON file does not yet exist in the
				APF Configuration Modeler, it is created and the description and semantic object are
				filled based on the information in the JSON file. Otherwise, the configuration of
				the JSON file is added to an existing application.</p>

			<p class="p">If a configuration with the same GUID already exists, you can decide whether you want
				to overwrite it or create a new one. You can now edit the configuration and save the
				changes.</p>

Please read the <a href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=">legal disclaimer</a> for video links before viewing this video.</div><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Szok98k0S0w" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen">

			<p class="p">If you use <span class="ph pname">SAP S/4HANA</span>, you
				have the following options:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio6528aa8787c94993a971697025cc4290__ul_s1x_vz5_1v">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">Import Delivered Content</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">Import Files</span></p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">You can use <span class="ph uicontrol">Import Files</span> to import files that result from a
				configuration export. The procedure is the same as described above for SAP Business
				Suite powered by SAP HANA.</p>

			<p class="p">If you want to import content that was delivered by SAP, you donâ€™t have to copy the
				files from a BSP application. You can import them from the layered repository of the
				SAPUI5 flexibility services using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Import Delivered
					Content</span> function.</p>

			<p class="p">The configuration file of a shipped application and the text properties file in the
				development language reside in the <samp class="ph codeph">VENDOR</samp> layer of the layered
				repository. When you import the content, it is copied to the
					<samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer. Changes you make to the configuration or the
				texts are also written into the <samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer, so the original
				files in the <samp class="ph codeph">VENDOR</samp> layer remain unchanged.</p>

			<p class="p">However, when a new version of a configuration is delivered with a support package,
				this update overwrites the version in the <samp class="ph codeph">VENDOR</samp> layer, so in this
				case the version in the <samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer remains unchanged. To see
				the updated version in the APF Configuration Modeler, you must first import the
				configuration again from the <samp class="ph codeph">VENDOR</samp> layer into the
					<samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Import Delivered
					Content</span> function.</p>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> When you have imported and edited a configuration and then later on
				import an updated version from the <samp class="ph codeph">VENDOR</samp> layer, this new import
				overwrites the changes you have already made in the <samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer.
				To prevent this, you can copy the configuration before editing it and then work on
				the copy.</div>

			<p class="p">At runtime, the system first checks whether there is a configuration file and a text
				properties file in the <samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer. Only if there are no files
				in the <samp class="ph codeph">CUSTOMER</samp> layer, is the application run from the files in the
					<samp class="ph codeph">VENDOR</samp> layer. </p>
