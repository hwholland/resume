	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In addition to those performed automatically by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>, the application can
		apply further platform adaptations.</p>

		<p class="p">You can use the <span class="keyword apiname">sap.ui.Device</span> API to check for touch enablement, a
			particular screen size, orientation, browser or operating system, for example. For more
			information about this API, see <a class="xref" href="69a8e469fbde46e7b8916250080effbd.html" title="The device API (sap.ui.Device) is an API which provides information about device specifics, like the operating system along with its version, the browser and browser version, screen size, current orientation and support for specific features like touch event support, orientation change and so on.">The Device API</a>.</p>

		<p class="p">Besides using this API, there are also several options available for you to use by using
			CSS, as outlined below.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio04eb5203d1c649b796fab12a09e600ef__section_N10018_N10011_N10001"><div class="section_title">Hiding/Displaying Controls Depending on the Device</div><div type="Hiding/Displaying Controls Depending on the Device">
			
			<p class="p">To determine a control’s visibility in a device-dependent way, you can use the
				following CSS classes:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio04eb5203d1c649b796fab12a09e600ef__ul_ztp_xz3_nt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sapUiVisibleOnlyOnDesktop</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sapUiHideOnDesktop</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sapUiVisibleOnlyOnTablet</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sapUiHideOnTablet</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sapUiVisibleOnlyOnPhone</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sapUiHideOnPhone</span></p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="p">The names are actually self-explanatory; for each device, you have a corresponding
				class that you can use to either explicitly hide or show the particular control. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">The control will still be part of the app but hidden by CSS only. For
						managing visibility on a generic level, consider controlling the visible
						property with the device API instead, as this means the controls will not be
						added to the DOM at all but just treated as invisible by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio04eb5203d1c649b796fab12a09e600ef__section_N100DD_N10011_N10001"><div class="section_title">Responsive Margin and Padding Classes</div><div type="Responsive Margin and Padding Classes">
			
			<p class="p">In order to make it possible for app developers to adjust margins and paddings in
				their apps without needing to write their own CSS, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> provides them
				with convenience classes. For responsiveness, the classes
					<span class="keyword apiname">sapUiResponsiveMargin</span> and
					<span class="keyword apiname">sapUiResponsiveContentPadding</span> are particularly useful.</p>

			<p class="p">To read more detailed documentation about margins and padding classes, see <a class="xref" href="777168ffe8324873973151dae2356d1c.html" title="SAPUI5 gives you the option of adding spacing in between controls by adding a margin. A margin clears an area around its respective control, outside of its border.">Using Predefined CSS Margin Classes</a> and <a class="xref" href="c71f6df62dae47ca8284310a6f5fc80a.html" title="For many container controls in SAPUI5, such as a Dialog or a Page, you can define whether the container should have a padding within the content area. A padding clears the area between the container layout and the controls that are displayed in the content area.">Using Container Content Padding CSS Classes</a> respectively.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Writing Device-Dependent Custom CSS</div><div type="Writing Device-Dependent Custom CSS">
			
			<p class="p">It is easy to add your own device-dependent or screen-size-dependent custom CSS by
				prefixing your selectors with the classes that come from the device API (for more
				information about the device API, see the link below under <span class="ph uicontrol">Related
					Information</span>). Whenever you need to set a particular style on, say, a
				small screen like a phone only, you can do so by picking the
					<span class="keyword apiname">sapUiMedia-Std-Phone</span> CSS class as part of your selector. For
				example, a particular style for phone only could look like this:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
.sapUiMedia-Std-Phone .yourSelector{
	Style-applied-to-phone-only: someValue;
}</pre></div>

			<p class="p">Additionally, the information regarding which device you are currently on is
				available on the html root tag as one of these three CSS classes:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio04eb5203d1c649b796fab12a09e600ef__ul_vsx_hbj_nt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sap-desktop</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sap-tablet</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="keyword apiname">sap-phone</span></p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">This means you can provide style for the phone use case using CSS cascades as
				follows:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
.sap-phone .myControl {
      font-size: small;
}</pre></div>

			<p class="p">The main difference between the two options is that the first one makes assumptions
				based on the current range interval (so the screen size), whereas the latter is
				indeed set depending on which device is present.</p>

			<p class="p">You might also consider checking the screen size using media queries in CSS or the
				browser/jQuery APIS in JavaScript.</p>
