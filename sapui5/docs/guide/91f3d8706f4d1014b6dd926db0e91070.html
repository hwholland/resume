    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The following section provides information about security aspects of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>. The information is
        intended for <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> application
        and control developers, as well as to system administrators running applications based on
            <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is a client-side
            JavaScript library, so while the library itself is designed and tested to be secure, it
            cannot ensure the application to be secure. Unlike WebDynpro, where the application is
            built against an abstract programming model and the framework handles the HTML
            rendering, JavaScript code and communication with the browser, in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> the application
            controls the HTML output and provides its own JavaScript code. This code is executed on
            the client and it handles client/server communication.</p>

        <p class="p">While this brings a lot of freedom and possibilities for the application, it comes with a
            lot of responsibility with regards to security. Application developers need to
            understand the security threats and actively prohibit exploitation. Also important is
            the correct configuration of the used HTTP server.</p>

        <p class="p">Moreover, common security mechanisms, which are usually taken for granted, like user
            authentication, session handling, authorization handling, or encryption are not part of
                <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> and need to be
            handled by the server-side framework and/or custom code of the application.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="section_title">Further Reading</div><div type="Further Reading">
            
            <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is not bound to any server implementation or server-side programming language
                and can, thus, be used with <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP</span>, Java, HANA XS Engine, or any
                standard web server. Therefore, the corresponding Security Guides also apply to
                <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>.</p>

            <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> We highly recommend that you implement SAP note 1582870 for ABAP XSS escaping
                support.</div>
