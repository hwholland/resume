	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a widely known vulnerability most web sites have. This
		page does not provide general information about cross-site scripting but focuses on what you
		as an application developer using <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> can do to avoid these security issues.</p>
<p class="p">To give a short info on XSS: It is about injecting script code into a
		web page, which is then executed in the context of the page and therefore not
		only can access any information which currently displayed on the screen but can
		either access session information contained in cookies, or send new requests to
		the server within the current session, or even try to exploit browser
		vulnerabilities to get full access to the machine the browser is running on. 
	 </p>
<div class="section" id="loio91f0bd316f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_04390290F9604EFFB4DB3019FA3E9F73"><div class="section_title">Cross-site Scripting in SAPUI5-based Web Applications</div><div type="Cross-site Scripting in SAPUI5-based Web Applications"> 
	 	 
		<p class="p">AJAX frameworks in general are an interesting target for XSS exploits,
		  as not only the HTML which is initially sent to the browser may contain
		  vulnerabilities, but also the code which is used to visualize content on the
		  client side may have bugs which can be exploited to get the JavaScript coding
		  executed on the client side. In addition to that, once a script has injected an
		  AJAX application, it will be alive for a long time, as usually navigation will
		  not reload the whole page which would also clean up any running JavaScript
		  code, but stays within the same HTML document and uses a delta update mechanism
		  to show new content. 
		</p>
 
	 	<p class="p">It is important to understand that <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is not involved in creating the HTML page which is
	 		sent to the client, so there is no way <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> can prevent XSS vulnerabilities which
	 		are contained in the HTML page itself. The application which is using the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>
				rendering has to take care, according to the documentation of their server-side
				rendering framework, to properly escape user data, in a way that no JavaScript can
				be injected. </p>
 
	 	<p class="p">The <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> framework will take care of proper escaping for all content which is created and
	 		displayed on the screen using the controls provided by <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>. There is no need for
				the application to HTML-escape user data, but the control API expects all data to be
				unescaped, so that it can be escaped as needed for the context it will be
				visualized. </p>
