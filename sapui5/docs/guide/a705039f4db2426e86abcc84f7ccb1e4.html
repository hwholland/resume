		card via the view switch feature. </p>

		<p class="p">The view switch feature is enabled through a dropdown menu below the header area. Applications
			will have to add configurations to the application descriptor (manifest file) where they
			can specify the different annotations that make up each of the individual cards, which
			in turn makes up the combined card. The following is an example setting for one such
			card:</p>

		<div class="p">In the example above, there would be a dropdown within the card that would show two
			values – <span class="ph uicontrol">By Supplier</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">By Country</span>.  The
			annotations to be used when each of these values are chosen are as per the tab setting
			above the respective value selected from the dropdown. With this feature, each selection
			from the dropdown could have its own chart with its own filter criteria (annotation path
				<samp class="ph codeph">selection</samp> ), its own sort criteria (annotation path
				<samp class="ph codeph">presentation</samp> ), its own navigation criteria (annotation path
				<samp class="ph codeph">identification</samp> ) or its own chart configuration (annotation path
				<samp class="ph codeph">chart</samp>). <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">It's recommended to only use this feature to show content that is very similar
					and not to use this for unrelated views or have one view that serves as a
					drilldown page for other views.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Use Cases</div><div type="Use Cases"><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Group By</p>

				<p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">Group by </span>could be used if two analytic cards have the same
					filter and sort criteria, but differ in their group by clause. For example, one
					card could show show sales by supplier and the other by region. In this case, we
					could have a single analytic card instead of two. The card title could be
					"Sales" and the tab entry of the manifest would have two records – one with
					value "By Supplier" and the other with value "By Region". Both would have the
					same selection criteria, but would differ in the presentation variant. </p>

				<p class="p">The first records would correspond to a presentation variant that has the value
					"By Supplier" for the <samp class="ph codeph">GroupBy</samp> property, whereas the second one
					would have the value "By Region". The identification and chart annotation path
					would also be different for each of the tab entries.</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Sort By</p>

			</div><p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">Sort by</span> could be used if two cards have the same
				filter and navigation criteria, but differ in their sort criteria. For example, both
				cards show sales grouped by suppliers, but one card shows the top three supplies and
				the other card shows the bottom three. In this case, we could have a single card
				instead of two cards and the card title could be "Sales by Supplier" and the tab
				entry of manifest could have two records – one with value "Top 3 Suppliers" and the
				other with value "Bottom 3 Suppliers". Both would have the same selection criteria,
				but would differ in the presentation variant.</p>
<p class="p"> The first records would
				correspond to a presentation variant that have <samp class="ph codeph">SortOrder</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">MaxItems</samp> that correspond to the top three records, whereas the
				presentation variant of the second record will have a <samp class="ph codeph">SortOrder</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">MaxItem</samp> that correspond to the bottom three.</p>
<div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Filter</p>

			</div><p class="p">Filter could be used if two cards will have the same presentation
				variant and navigation criteria, but differ in their filter set. For example both
				cards shows "Sales" in Region="Europe" and Year="2016", but the first card shows
				Sales of Country="DE" and second shows Sales of Country="FR". In this case we could
				use a single card titled "Sales – Europe 2016" and the tab entry of manifest would
				have two records – one with country values "Germany" and "France". </p>
<p class="p">Both would
				have the same presentation, identification and chart/line item annotation, but would
				differ in their selection annotation due to different filter sets (first card has
				filters Region="Europe", Year="2016" and Country="DE", whereas the second card would
				have filters Region="Europe", Year="2016" and Country="FR")</p>
