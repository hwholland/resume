It consists of two parts: the date input field and the date picker.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the <code>DatePicker</code> is opened (not used for the initial rendering). If the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library is not loaded before the <code>DatePicker</code> is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the <code>DatePicker</code> is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the <code>DatePicker</code> should also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\nThe user can enter a date by: <ul><li>Using the calendar that opens in a popup</li> <li>Typing it in directly in the input field (not available for mobile devices)</li></ul>\n\nOn app level, there are two options to provide a date for the <code>DatePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property or as a JavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one of these properties should be used at a time):\n\n<ul><li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the <code>DatePicker</code> to a model using the <code>sap.ui.model.type.Date</code></li> <li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li> <li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n\nAll formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.\n\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n\nFor example, if the <code>valueFormat</code> is \"yyyy-MM-dd\", the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"MMM d, y\", and the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"2015-07-30\", which leads to an output of \"Jul 30, 2015\".\n\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>DatePicker</code>, the used <code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code> (from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>DatePicker</code> is smaller in compact mode and provides a touch-friendly size in cozy mode.\n\nOn mobile devices, one tap on the input field opens the <code>DatePicker</code> in full screen. To close the window, the user can select a date (which triggers the close event), or select Cancel.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"displayFormatType","type":"string","defaultValue":"","group":"Appearance","visibility":"public","since":"1.28.6","description":"Displays date in this given type in input field.

They can also navigate directly from one month or year to another.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the <code>DateRangeSelection</code> is opened (not used for the initial rendering). If the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library is not loaded before the <code>DateRangeSelection</code> is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the <code>DateRangeSelection</code> is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the <code>DateRangeSelection</code> should also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\n<i>When to use?</i>\n\nIf you need a time range and know that your user is a power user who has to input lots of data. If the keyboard is the primary device used for navigating the app, use two input fields. This allows the user to quickly jump from field to field. By selecting a date in one of the fields, the other field should recognize the information and jump to the same selection.\n\n<i>When not to use?</i>\n\nIf the user's primary goal is not to select ranges or if you just want to enter a date and a time. For such cases, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or {@link sap.m.TimePicker}.\n\nThe user can enter a date by: <ul><li>Using the calendar that opens in a popup</li> <li>Typing it in directly in the input field (not available for mobile devices)</li></ul>\n\nOn app level, there are two options to provide a date for the <code>DateRangeSelection</code> - date range as a string to the <code>value</code> property or JavaScript Date objects to the <code>dateValue</code> and <code>secondDateValue</code> properties (only one of these options should be used at a time):\n\n<ul><li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date range is already provided as a formatted string</li> <li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> and <code>secondDateValue</code> properties if the date range is already provided as JavaScript Date objects or you want to work with JavaScript Date objects</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n\nAll formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.\n\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n\nFor example, if the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"MMM d, y\", delimiter is \"-\", and the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"Jul 29, 2015 - Jul 31, 2015\" and it is displayed in the same way in the input field.\n\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>DateRangeSelection</code>, the used <code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code> (from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>DateRangeSelection</code> is fully responsive. It is smaller in compact mode and provides a touch-friendly size in cozy mode.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"delimiter","type":"string","defaultValue":"-","group":"Misc","visibility":"public","description":"Delimiter between start and end date.

If the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library is not loaded before the <code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the <code>DateTimePicker</code> is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the <code>DateTimePicker</code> should also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\nUse this control if you need a combined date and time input control.\n\nDon't use it if you want to use either a date or a time value. In this case, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or the {@link sap.m.TimePicker} controls instead.\n\nThe user can enter a date by: <ul> <li>Using the calendar or a time selector that opens in a popup</li> <li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li></ul>\n\nOn app level, there are two options to provide a date for the <code>DateTimePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property or as a JavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one of these properties should be used at a time):\n\n<ul><li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the <code>DateTimePicker</code> to a model using the <code>sap.ui.model.type.DateTime</code></li> <li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li> <li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n\nAll formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.\n\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n\nFor example, if the <code>valueFormat</code> is \"yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss\", the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"MMM d, y, HH:mm:ss\", and the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"2015-07-30-10-30-15\", which leads to an output of \"Jul 30, 2015, 10:30:15\".\n\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>DateTimePicker</code>, the used <code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code> (from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>DateTimePicker</code> is responsive and fully adapts to all devices. For larger screens, such as tablet or desktop, it opens as a popover. For mobile devices, it opens in full screen.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","aggregations":[{"name":"_popup","singularName":"_popup","type":"sap.m.ResponsivePopover","cardinality":"0..1","visibility":"hidden","description":"Internal aggregation that contains the inner _picker pop-up.","methods":["get_popup","destroy_popup","set_popup"]}],"designtime":"sap/m/designtime/DateTimePicker.designtime"},"constructor":{"visibility":"public","parameters":[{"name":"sId","type":"string","optional":true,"description":"ID for the new control, generated automatically if no ID is given"},{"name":"mSettings","type":"object","optional":true,"description":"Initial settings for the new control"}],"description":"Constructor for a new <code>DateTimePicker</code>.\n\nAccepts an object literal <code>mSettings</code> that defines initial property values, aggregated and associated objects as well as event handlers.

To enable this, you need to set the properties <code>resizable</code> and <code>draggable</code> accordingly.\n\nThere are other specialized types of dialogs: <ul> <li>{@link sap.m.P13nDialog Personalization dialog} - used for personalizing sorting, filtering and grouping in tables</li> <li>{@link sap.m.SelectDialog Select dialog} - used to select one or more items from a comprehensive list</li> <li>{@link sap.m.TableSelectDialog Table select dialog} - used to make a selection from a comprehensive table containing multiple attributes or values</li> <li>{@link sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog Value help dialog} - used to help the user find and select single and multiple values</li> <li>{@link sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog View settings dialog} - used to sort, filter, or group data within a (master) list or a table</li> <li>{@link sap.m.BusyDialog Busy dialog} - used to block the screen and inform the user about an ongoing operation</li> </ul> <h3>Usage</h3> <h4>When to use:</h4> <ul> <li>You want to display a system message.</li> <li>You want to interrupt the user’s action.</li> <li>You want to show a message with a short and a long description.</li> </ul> <h4>When not to use:</h4> <ul> <li>You just want to confirm a successful action.</li> </ul> <h3>Responsive Behavior</h3> <ul> <li>If the <code>stretch</code> property is set to true, the dialog displays on full screen.</li> <li>If the <code>contentWidth</code> and/or <code>contentHeight</code> properties are set, the dialog will try to fill those sizes.</li> <li>If there is no specific sizing, the dialog will try to adjust its size to its content.</li> </ul> <h4>Smartphones</h4> If the dialog has one or two actions they will cover the entire footer. If there are more actions, they will overflow. <h4>Tablets</h4> The action buttons in the toolbar are <b>right-aligned</b>. Use <b>cozy</b> mode on tablet devices. <h4>Desktop</h4> The action buttons in the toolbar are <b>right-aligned</b>. Use <b>compact</b> mode on desktop.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"icon","type":"sap.ui.core.URI","defaultValue":null,"group":"Appearance","visibility":"public","description":"Icon displayed in the dialog's header.

When you use this feature, be aware that it only works with one-way data binding. Having growing feature enabled when the <code>items</code> aggregation is bound to a model with two-way data binding, may lead to unexpected and/or inconsistent behavior across browsers, such as unexpected closing of the list.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\nUse the <code>FacetFilter</code> if your app displays a large list of items that can be grouped by multiple parameters, for example products by category and supplier. With the <code>FacetFilter</code>, you allow the users to dynamically filter the list so it only displays products from the categories and suppliers they want to see.\n\nWhile the {@link sap.m.FacetFilterList} popup is opened (when the user selects a button corresponding to the list's name), any other activities leading to focus change will close it. For example, when the popup is opened and the app developer loads a {@link sap.m.BusyDialog} or any other dialog that obtains the focus, the popup will be closed.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>FacetFilter</code> supports the following two types, which can be configured using the control's <code>type</code> property:\n\n<ul><li>Simple type (default) - only available for desktop and tablet screen sizes. The active facets are displayed as individually selectable buttons on the toolbar.</li> <li>Light type - automatically enabled on smart phone sized devices, but also available for desktop and tablets. The active facets and selected filter items are displayed in the summary bar. When the user selects the summary bar, a navigable dialog list of all facets is displayed. When the user selects a facet, the dialog scrolls to show the list of filters that are available for the selected facet.</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\n\nFor more information, go to <b>Developer Guide</b> section in the Demo Kit and navigate to <b>More&nbsp;About&nbsp;Controls</b>&nbsp;>&nbsp;<b>sap.m</b>&nbsp;>&nbsp;<b>Facet&nbsp;Filter</b>","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"showPersonalization","type":"boolean","defaultValue":false,"group":"Appearance","visibility":"public","description":"If set to <code>true</code> and the FacetFilter type is <code>Simple</code>, then the Add Facet icon will be displayed and each facet button will also have a Facet Remove icon displayed beside it, allowing the user to deactivate the facet.","methods":["getShowPersonalization","setShowPersonalization"]},{"name":"type","type":"sap.m.FacetFilterType","defaultValue":"Simple","group":"Appearance","visibility":"public","description":"Defines the default appearance of the FacetFilter on the device.

Controls that implement this interface must provide a <code>getOverflowToolbarConfig</code> method that accepts no arguments and returns an object with the following fields: <ul> <li><code>canOverflow</code> - A boolean that tells whether the control can move to the overflow menu or not.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Even if <code>canOverflow</code> is set to <code>false</code>, the <code>propsUnrelatedToSize</code> field is taken into account, allowing to optimize the behavior of controls that do not need to overflow, but are used in an <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> regardless.</li>\n\n<li><code>autoCloseEvents</code> - An array of strings, listing all of the control's events that should trigger the closing of the overflow menu, when fired.</li>\n\n<li><code>propsUnrelatedToSize</code> - An array of strings, listing all of the control's properties that, when changed, should not cause the overflow toolbar to invalidate.\n\n<b>Note:</b> By default <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> invalidates whenever any property of a child control changes. This is to ensure that whenever the size of a child control changes, the overflow toolbar's layout is recalculated. Some properties however do not affect control size, making it unnecessary to invalidate the overflow toolbar when they change. You can list them here for optimization purposes.</li>\n\n<li><code>onBeforeEnterOverflow(oControl)</code> - A callback function that will be invoked before moving the control into the overflow menu. The control instance will be passed as an argument.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The context of the function is not the control instance (use the <code>oControl</code> parameter for this purpose), but rather an internal helper object, associated with the current <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> instance. This object only needs to be manipulated in special cases (e.g. when you want to store state on it, rather than on the control instance).</li>\n\n<li><code>onAfterExitOverflow(oControl)</code> - A callback function that will be invoked after taking the control out of the overflow menu (before moving it back to the toolbar itself). The control instance will be passed as an argument.\n\n<b>Note:</b> See: <code>onBeforeEnterOverflow</code> for details about the function's context.</li>\n\n<li><code>getCustomImportance()</code> - A function that, if provided, will be called to determine the priority of the control. This function must return a value of type <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbarPriority</code>. The string \"Medium\" is also accepted and interpreted as priority between <code>Low</code> and <code>High<code>.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Normally priority in <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbar</code> is managed with the <code>priority</code> property of <code>sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData</code>. However, some controls may have other means of defining priority, such as dedicated properties or other types of layout data for that purpose. In summary, implementing this function allows a control to override the default priority logic (<code>sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData</code>) by providing its own.</li> </ul>\n\n<b>Important:</b> In addition, the control can implement a CSS class, scoped with the <code>.sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX</code> context selector, that will be applied whenever the control is inside the overflow menu. For example, to make your control take up the whole width of the overflow menu, you can add a context class to your control's base CSS file like this:\n\n<pre>\n      .sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX .sapMyControlClass {\n      \twidth: 100%;\n      }\n  </pre>"},{"kind":"interface","name":"sap.m.IScale","basename":"IScale","resource":"sap/m/library.js","module":"sap/m/library","export":"IScale","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"1.46","description":"Interface for controls which are suitable as a Scale for the Slider/RangeSlider."},{"kind":"interface","name":"sap.m.ISliderTooltip","basename":"ISliderTooltip","resource":"sap/m/library.js","module":"sap/m/library","export":"ISliderTooltip","static":true,"visibility":"public","since":"1.54","description":"Interface for controls which are suitable as a Tooltip for the Slider/RangeSlider."},{"kind":"class","name":"sap.m.Label","basename":"Label","resource":"sap/m/Label.js","module":"sap/m/Label","export":"","static":true,"visibility":"public","extends":"sap.ui.core.Control","implements":["sap.ui.core.Label","sap.ui.core.IShrinkable","sap.m.IOverflowToolbarContent"],"description":"Provides a textual label for other controls.

It provides a handy and systemized way to navigate and explore details for every message. <h4>Notes:</h4> <ul> <li> Messages can have descriptions pre-formatted with HTML markup. In this case, the <code>markupDescription</code> has to be set to <code>true</code>.</li> <li> If the message cannot be fully displayed or includes a long description, the message popover provides navigation to the detailed description.</li> </ul> <h3>Structure</h3> The message popover stores all messages in an association of type {@link sap.m.MessageItem} named <code>items</code>.\n\nA set of properties determines how the items are rendered: <ul> <li> counter - An integer that is used to indicate the number of errors for each type </li> <li> type - The type of message </li> <li> title/subtitle - The title and subtitle of the message</li> <li> description - The long text description of the message</li> </ul> <h3>Usage</h3> With the message concept, MessagePopover provides a way to centrally manage messages and show them to the user without additional work for the developer. The message popover is triggered from a messaging button in the footer toolbar. If an error has occurred at any validation point, the total number of messages should be incremented, but the user's work shouldn't be interrupted. <h3>Responsive Behavior</h3> On mobile phones, the message popover is automatically shown in full screen mode.<br> On desktop and tablet, the message popover opens in a popover.<br> On desktop the opened popover is resizable if it is placed in a {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, {@link sap.m.Bar} or used in {@link sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage}","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"asyncDescriptionHandler","type":"any","defaultValue":null,"group":"Behavior","visibility":"public","description":"Callback function for resolving a promise after description has been asynchronously loaded inside this function","methods":["getAsyncDescriptionHandler","setAsyncDescriptionHandler"]},{"name":"asyncURLHandler","type":"any","defaultValue":null,"group":"Behavior","visibility":"public","description":"Callback function for resolving a promise after a link has been asynchronously validated inside this function","methods":["getAsyncURLHandler","setAsyncURLHandler"]},{"name":"placement","type":"sap.m.VerticalPlacementType","defaultValue":"Vertical","group":"Behavior","visibility":"public","description":"Determines the position, where the control will appear on the screen.

This page should then have the CSS class \"sapMNavItemHidden\". For adding/removing this or other CSS classes, the transition can use the addStyleClass/removeStyleClass method: oFromPage.addStyleClass(\"sapMNavItemHidden\"); When the transition is complete, it MUST call the given fCallback method to inform the NavContainer that navigation has finished!\n\nHint: if the target page of your transition stays black on iPhone, try wrapping the animation start into a setTimeout(..., 0) block (delayed, but without waiting).\n\nThis method can be called on any NavContainer instance or statically on the sap.m.NavContainer type.

The standard header includes a navigation button and a title.

This can be prevented by setting <code>enableScrolling</code> to <code>false</code>. <h4>Footer</h4> The footer is optional and occupies the fixed bottom part of the page. Alternatively, the footer can be floating above the bottom part of the content.

It can be collapsed to save space on the screen. <h4>Guidelines:</h4> <ul> <li>Nesting two or more panels is not recommended.</li> <li>Do not stack too many panels on one page.</li> </ul> <h3>Structure</h3> A panel consists of a title bar with a header text or header toolbar, an info toolbar (optional), and a content area. Using the <code>headerToolbar</code> aggregation, you can add a toolbar with any toolbar content (i.e. custom buttons, spacers, titles) inside the title bar.\n\nThere are two types of panels: fixed and expandable. Expendable panels are enabled by the <code>expandable</code> property. Furthermore you can define an expand animation with the property <code>expandAnimation</code>. <h3>Usage</h3> <h4>When to use:</h4> <ul> <li>You need to group or display information and want to give users the option of hiding this information.</li> <li>You want to show additional information on demand (for example, a panel could show optional input fields for an advanced search).</li> <li>You want to create a panel with controls that do not require user interaction and are not part of a form. Depending on the usage, change the <code>accessibleRole</code> property from the default <code>{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Form}</code> to <code>{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Region}</code> or <code>{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Complementary}</code>.</li> </ul> <h3>Responsive Behavior</h3> <ul> <li>If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are resized responsively, depending on its parent container.</li> <li>If the panel has a fixed defined height, it will take up the space, even if the panel is collapsed.</li> <li>When the panel is expandable, an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header.</li> <li>When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or close the content area.</li> <li>When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise.</li> <li>When the height uses the default property <code>auto</code>, the height of the content area is automatically adjusted to match the height of its content.</li> <li>When the height of the panel is set to a fixed size, the content area can be scrolled through.</li> </ul>","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"headerText","type":"string","defaultValue":"","group":"Data","visibility":"public","description":"This property is used to set the header text of the Panel.

The available navigation allows the user to select a specific interval using a picker, or move to the previous/next interval using arrows.\n\n<b>Note:</b> The <code>PlanningCalendar</code> uses parts of the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library. This library will be loaded after the <code>PlanningCalendar</code>, if it wasn't loaded first. This could lead to a waiting time when a <code>PlanningCalendar</code> is used for the first time. To prevent this, apps that use the <code>PlanningCalendar</code> should also load the <code>sap.ui.unified</code> library.\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\nThe <code>PlanningCalendar</code> has the following structure from top to bottom:\n\n<ul> <li>A toolbar where you can add your own buttons or other controls using the <code>toolbarContent</code> aggregation.</li> <li>A header containing a drop-down menu for selecting the {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarView PlanningCalendarViews}, and navigation for moving through the intervals using arrows or selecting a specific interval with a picker. Custom views can be configured using the <code>views</code> aggregation. If not configured, the following set of default built-in views is available - Hours, Days, 1 Week, 1 Month, and Months. Setting a custom view(s) replaces the built-in ones.</li> <li>The rows of the <code>PlanningCalendar</code> that contain the assigned appointments. They can be configured with the <code>rows</code> aggregation, which is of type {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow PlanningCalendarRow}.</li> </ul>\n\nSince 1.48 the empty space in the cell that is below an appointment can be removed by adding the <code>sapUiCalendarAppFitVertically</code> CSS class to the <code>PlanningCalendar</code>. Please note that it should be used only for a <code>PlanningCalendar</code> with one appointment per day for a row that doesn't have interval headers set.\n\nSince 1.44 alternating row colors can be suppressed by adding the <code>sapMPlanCalSuppressAlternatingRowColors</code> CSS class to the <code>PlanningCalendar</code>.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nYou can define the number of displayed intervals based on the size of the <code>PlanningCalendar</code> using the {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarView PlanningCalendarView}'s properties.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"startDate","type":"object","defaultValue":null,"group":"Data","visibility":"public","description":"Determines the start date of the row, as a JavaScript date object.

The list used in the dialog is a growing list and can be filled with any kind of list item. <h3>Structure</h3> <h4>Dialog structure</h4> The select dialog has the following components: <ul> <li>Header - title of the dialog</li> <li>Search field - input field to enter search terms</li> <li>Info toolbar (only in multi-select) - displays the number of currently selected items</li> <li>Content - {@link sap.m.StandardListItem standard list items}, {@link sap.m.DisplayListItem display list items} or {@link sap.m.FeedListItem feed list items}</li> <li>Button toolbar - for confirmation/cancellation buttons </li> </ul> <h4>List structure & selection</h4> <ul> <li> The search field triggers the events <code>search</code> and <code>liveChange</code> where a filter function can be applied to the list binding. </li> <li> The growing functionality of the list does not support two-way Binding, so if you use this control with a JSON model make sure the binding mode is set to <code>OneWay</code> and that you update the selection model manually with the items passed in the <code>confirm</code> event. </li> <li> In the multi-select mode of the select dialog, checkboxes are provided for choosing multiple entries. </li> <li> You can set <code>rememberSelections</code> to true to store the current selection and load this state when the dialog is opened again. </li> <li> When cancelling the selection, the event <code>change</code> will be fired and the selection is restored to the state when the dialog was opened. </li> </ul> <h3>Usage</h3> <h4>When to use:</h4> <ul> <li>You need to select one or more entries from a comprehensive list that contains multiple attributes or values. </li> </ul> <h4>When not to use:</h4> <ul> <li> You need to pick one item from a predefined set of options. Use {@link sap.m.Select select} or {@link sap.m.ComboBox combobox} instead. </li> <li> You need to select a range of item. Use {@link sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog value help dialog instead. </li> <li> You need to be able to add your own values to an existing list.

For example, when using the keyboard page up/down keys the value increases/decreases with a double of the default step.

If you want the user to select a duration (1 hour), use the {@link sap.m.Select} control instead.\n\nThe user can enter a date by:\n\n<ul><li>Using the <code>TimePicker</code> dropdown that opens in a popup</li> <li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li></ul>\n\nOn app level, there are two options to provide value for the <code>TimePicker</code> - as a string to the <code>value</code> property or as a JavaScript Date object to the <code>dateValue</code> property (only one of these properties should be used at a time):\n\n<ul><li>Use the <code>value</code> property if you want to bind the <code>TimePicker</code> to a model using the <code>sap.ui.model.type.Time</code></li> <li>Use the <code>value</code> property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for example, as ABAP type DATS field)</li> <li>Use the <code>dateValue</code> property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want to work with a JavaScript Date object</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Formatting</h3>\n\nAll formatting and parsing of values from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}. If a value is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format and locale.\n\nSupported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}\n\nA time format must be specified, otherwise the default \"HH:mm:ss a\" will be used. For example, if the <code>valueFormat</code> is \"HH-mm-ss a\", the <code>displayFormat</code> is \"HH:mm:ss a\", and the used locale is English, a valid value string is \"10-30-15 AM\", which leads to an output of \"10:30:15 AM\".\n\nIf no placeholder is set to the <code>TimePicker</code>, the used <code>displayFormat</code> is displayed as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.\n\n<b>Note:</b> If the string does NOT match the <code>displayFormat</code> (from user input) or the <code>valueFormat</code> (on app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.\n\n<h3>Responsive behavior</h3>\n\nThe <code>TimePicker</code> is responsive and fully adapts to all device types. For larger screens, such as tablet or desktop, it opens as a popover. For mobile devices, it opens in full screen.","ui5-metadata":{"stereotype":"control","properties":[{"name":"localeId","type":"string","defaultValue":null,"group":"Data","visibility":"public","description":"Defines the locale used to parse string values representing time.\n\nDetermines the locale, used to interpret the string, supplied by the <code>value</code> property.\n\nExample: AM in the string \"09:04 AM\" is locale (language) dependent.
