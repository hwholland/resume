                                 				intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single
                                 				managed property etc. (e.g. a function setSize(value) that sets a new value for
                                 				property &apos;size&apos;). sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend creates default implementations
                                 				of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation of a subclass
                                 				then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation,
                                 				e.g. to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is
                                 				therefore important to understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT
                                 				SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed object, as that would bypass
                                 				the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.
