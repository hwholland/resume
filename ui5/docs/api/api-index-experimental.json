Currently, it is enabled during the OPENING phase and disabled during the CLOSING phase. The only potential change would be to treat the OPENING phase as disabled as well.

If the mentioned potential change should happen, the dialog will become enabled only after the transition to OPEN. Events from \"enabled\" children then can still only arrive between open() and close(), so applications that obey the previous rule should continue to work. Only end users or code that explicitly triggers pseudo user events will notice a difference. <br> A second aspect that might change is the visual behavior of the content: during the CLOSING phase it 'looks' enabled but in fact it is already disabled.

Javascript, CSS, JSON, XML, ...). URNs are similar to the path component of a URL: <ul> <li>they consist of a non-empty sequence of name segments</li> <li>segments are separated by a forward slash '/'</li> <li>name segments consist of URL path segment characters only. It is recommended to use only ASCII letters (upper or lower case), digits and the special characters '$', '_', '-', '.')</li> <li>the empty name segment is not supported</li> <li>names consisting of dots only, are reserved and must not be used for resources</li> <li>names are case sensitive although the underlying server might be case-insensitive</li> <li>the behavior with regard to URL encoded characters is not specified, %ddd notation should be avoided</li> <li>the meaning of a leading slash is undefined, but might be defined in future. It therefore should be avoided</li> </ul>\n\nUI5 APIs that only deal with Javascript resources, use a slight variation of this scheme, where the extension '.js' is always omitted (see {@link sap.ui.define}, {@link sap.ui.require}).\n\n<b>Relationship to old Module Name Syntax</b><br>\n\nOlder UI5 APIs that deal with resources (like {@link jQuery.sap.registerModulePath}, {@link jQuery.sap.require} and {@link jQuery.sap.declare}) used a dot-separated naming scheme (called 'module names') which was motivated by object names in the global namespace in Javascript.\n\nThe new URN scheme better matches the names of the corresponding resources (files) as stored in a server and the dot ('.') is no longer a forbidden character in a resource name. This finally allows to handle resources with different types (extensions) with the same API, not only JS files.\n\nLast but not least does the URN scheme better match the naming conventions used by AMD loaders (like <code>requireJS</code>).","type":"methods","static":true,"visibility":"public","entityName":"getResourcePath","since":"1.27.0"},{"control":"sap.ui","text":"Support for asyncHints is still experimental and might be modified or removed completely again.
