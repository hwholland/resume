		<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses data binding to bind
			two data sources or information sources together to keep them in sync: All changes in
			one source are also reflected in the other one.</p>

		<p class="p">For data binding, you need a model and a binding instance: The model instance holds the data
			and provides methods to set the data or to retrieve the data from a server. It also
			provides a method for creating bindings to the data. When this method is called, a
			binding instance is created, which contains the binding information and provides an
			event, which is fired whenever the bound data changes. An element can listen to this
			event and update its visualization according to the new data.</p>

		<p class="p">The UI uses data binding to bind controls to the model which holds the application data, so that the controls are updated automatically whenever
			application data changes. Data binding is also used the other way round, when changes in the control cause updates in the underlying application
			data, for example data entered by the user. This is called two-way binding.</p>

					your workspace and make sure that the application runs by calling the
						<samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html</samp> file.</p>

We will now change the user interface so that the first and last name fields are displayed using sap.m.Input fields and an additional check box control is used to enable or disable both input fields. This arrangement illustrates a feature known as &#34;two-way data binding&#34;. Now that the view contains more controls, we will also move the view definition into an XML file.">Step 4: Two-Way Data Binding</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="88756c08fe144ba08ff1762ad92fc07c.html" title="In contrast to the two-way binding behavior shown above, one-way data binding is also possible. Here, data is transported in one direction only: from the model, through the binding instance to the consumer (usually the property of a control), but never in the other direction. In this example, we will change the previous example to use one-way data binding. This will illustrate how the flow of data from the user interface back to the model can be switched off if required.">Step 5: One-Way Data Binding</a></strong><br/>

The properties within JSON and OData models almost always are arranged in a hierarchical structure. Therefore, we should take a look at how to reference fields in a hierarchically structured model object.">Step 8: Binding Paths: Accessing Properties in Hierarchically Structured Models</a></strong><br/>

<li><strong><a class="link" href="6fdf0acd0bc24ffdad327cf7e6f9e7e0.html" title="We also want to provide our users a way of contacting Harry Hawk. Therefore we will add a link that sends an e-mail to Harry. To achieve that we will convert our data in the model to match the sap.m.URLHelper.normalizeEmail API.

These data types can then be applied to controls in order to ensure that the value presented on the screen is formatted correctly, and, if the field is open for input, that the value entered by the user adheres to the requirements of that data type. We will now add a new field called Sales to Date of type Currency.">Step 10: Property Formatting Using Data Types</a></strong><br/>

The currency data type also has the ability to validate that user input adheres to to the requirements of a currency; however, data type validation functions are managed by OpenUI5, which of itself has no mechanism for reporting error messages back to the UI; therefore, we need a mechanism for reporting error messages raised by validation functions back to the user. In this step, we will connect the entire view to a feature known as the &#34;Message Manager&#34;. Once this connection is established, any validation error messages generated based on the user input will be passed to the message manager which in turn will connect them to the appropriate view and control that caused the error.">Step 11: Validation Using the Message Manager</a></strong><br/>

In most cases you will use a list to allow the selection of an item and then show the details of that item elsewhere.

In this example, we will change the color of the price depending on whether it is above or below some arbitrary threshold. The threshold value is also stored in the JSON model.">Step 14: Expression Binding</a></strong><br/>
