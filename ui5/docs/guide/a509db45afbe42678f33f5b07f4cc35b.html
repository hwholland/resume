		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Tags</div><div type="Tags">
			
			<div class="p">Gherkin supports the concept of tags. A tag is metadata that can augment a feature or scenario
				with contextual information. Tags begin with an @ symbol, appear on the line above a
				feature or scenario, and are separated by spaces. Tags can be added before a
				feature, a scenario, a scenario outline, or an
				example.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">@lemmings
Feature: Clicking Buttons is a Life Saving Activity

  @saved @button
  Scenario: Click a button, save a life!
    Then  I save a lemming's life
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">Tags on a feature level are inherited by all of the scenarios and scenario outlines in the
				feature. In addition, tags on a scenario outline are inherited by its examples. In
				the example above, the scenario has three tags: <samp class="ph codeph">@lemmings</samp>,
					<samp class="ph codeph">@saved</samp>, and <samp class="ph codeph">@button</samp>.</p>

			<div class="p">Tags generally help to understand the feature file, and have a number of  interesting uses:<ul class="ul" id="loioa509db45afbe42678f33f5b07f4cc35b__ul_uvx_l55_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Tags can function like a category to create collections of features or scenarios, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">@sales</samp> or
								<samp class="ph codeph">@human-resources</samp>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Tags can be used to refer to numbered documents, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">@BCP-1234567890</samp>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Tags can refer to the stage of the development process for that feature, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">@requirements</samp>,
								<samp class="ph codeph">@development</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">@testing</samp>.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p">There is one special tag : the <samp class="ph codeph">@wip</samp> tag. This tag indicates to the Gherkin
				test harness that it should skip that test during test execution. A skipped test is
				not executed and passes automatically. Use the <samp class="ph codeph">@wip</samp> tag when you're
				in the middle of implementing the tests for a feature file. You can also use it for
				scenarios or features that you have no intention of testing. </p>

			<p class="p">Here's an example of a test execution with a skipped test: </p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loioa509db45afbe42678f33f5b07f4cc35b__fig_pgh_2v5_kx"><div class="figcontainer">

			</div></div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Background scenarios</div><div type="Background scenarios">
			
			<div class="p">When writing a feature file, some test steps might need to be executed for every scenario. For
				example, the test step that loads the app is often repeated for each test scenario.
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Feature: Clicking Buttons is a Life Saving Activity

  Scenario: Click a button, save a life!
    Given I have started the app
    Then I save a lemming's life

  Scenario: The saved lemming has a name
    Given I have started the app
    Then I see Alice at the end of the list</pre></div>
You
				can consolidate all of the repeated steps into a single "background scenario", which
				uses the keyword <samp class="ph codeph">Background</samp>. The test steps in the background
				scenario get executed at the beginning of each scenario in the feature file. The
				following feature file is equivalent to the feature file shown above:
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Feature: Clicking Buttons is a Life Saving Activity

  Background:
    Given I have started the app

  Scenario: Click a button, save a life!
    Then I save a lemming's life

  Scenario: The saved lemming has a name
    Then I see Alice at the end of the list</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Step arguments and regular expressions</div><div type="Step arguments and regular expressions">
			
			<div class="p">When writing test steps in feature files, test steps are sometimes repeated, but with a slight
				variation in each
				step.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario: Save one lemming
  When I click on the life saving button 1 time
  Then I see Alice at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Scenario: Save two lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button 2 times
  Then I see Bob at the end of the list of saved lemmings</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">To write a steps file for the this feature file you might have to write four separate step definitions. The problem would only get worse if you
				needed to write more scenarios. However, using step arguments you can consolidate the four step definitions into two step definitions (written
				here in pseudo-code):</p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">I click on the life saving button &lt;X&gt; time(s)</samp></p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">I see &lt;NAME&gt; at the end of the list of saved lemmings </samp></p>

			<div class="p">How does this work in real JavaScript code? When you write the regular expression for the step
				definition, you can use a regular expression concept called "capturing groups" to
				specify arguments to extract from the natural language of the test step. If you've
				never worked with regular expressions before, it can take some getting used to, but
				it's a really powerful tool that is worth learning. The capturing groups are passed
				to the test function as parameters (of type <samp class="ph codeph">string</samp>) that you can
				name whatever you want. Continuing the example above, here are the step definitions
				that you could
				write:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">this.register(
  /^I click on the life saving button (\d+) times?$/i,
  function(sNumTimes) {}
);

this.register(
  /^I see (.*?) at the end of the list of saved lemmings$/i,
  function(sName) {}
);
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> All parameters extracted from capturing groups are of the JavaScript type <samp class="ph codeph">string</samp>. You will need to use
					<samp class="ph codeph">parseInt</samp> to convert numbers into type <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp> before you do a numerical comparison.</div>

			<div class="p">Here are a few regular expression concepts that are especially useful in
				Gherkin:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">(.*?) – captures any text into a parameter
(\d+) – captures any number into a parameter
\s* - matches 0 or more spaces
s? – matches the character "s" if it's there (replace "s" with any character)
(text)? – captures "text" into a parameter if it's there
(?:text)? – matches "text" if it's there, without capturing into a parameter
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">A common problem in regular expressions is that many characters are reserved and have a special meaning, in particular backslash
						(<samp class="ph codeph">\</samp>), period (<samp class="ph codeph">.</samp>), asterisk (<samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>), plus (<samp class="ph codeph">+</samp>), dash (<samp class="ph codeph">-</samp>)
					and braces (<samp class="ph codeph">[]</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">()</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">{}</samp>). Put the backslash character in front of a special character
					to treat it as plain text, for example: <samp class="ph codeph">\-</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">\+</samp>.</p>

				<p class="p">If your regular expression contains multiple parameters, then they will be passed to the test function in the same order as they appear in
					the regular expression.</p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">this.register(
  /^I click (\d+) times and see (.*?) at the end of the list$/i,
  function(sNumTimes, sName) {}
);</pre></div>

			</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Context</div><div type="Context">
			
			<div class="p">Look at the following feature file
				scenario:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario: some steps depend on each other
  Given I have a Latte Cappuccino in front of me
  When I drink the coffee
  Then I feel less sleepy
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">Trying to implement the step definitions might be a bit challenging because in the second step, <samp class="ph codeph">I drink the coffee</samp>, there is no mention
				of which coffee. Sometimes, to make a feature file sound more natural, or just to reduce repetition, it can be beneficial to retain the context
				from one test step to the next. </p>

			<div class="p">In Gherkin, the JavaScript <samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> variable is unique for each scenario. Any
				variables assigned to one step definition can be used in subsequent step definitions
				within the same scenario. Each new scenario in the feature starts with a new
					<samp class="ph codeph">this</samp> object. As a result, we could implement the previous
				feature file's step definitions in the following
				manner:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">this.register(/^I have a (.*?) in front of me$/i, function(coffeeType) {
  this.coffeeType = coffeeType;
});

this.register(/^I drink the coffee$/i, function() {
  this.sleepinessBefore = user.getSleepiness();
  user.drink(this.coffeeType);
});

this.register(/^I feel less sleepy$/i, function() {
  Opa5.assert.ok(user.getSleepiness() &lt; this.sleepinessBefore, "Verified...");
});

			<p class="p">To use QUnit for automated testing, it is necessary to use QUnit's built-in assertion
				methods. QUnit defines these assertion methods in the <samp class="ph codeph">QUnit.assert</samp>
				object. QUnit makes this object globally available to your test code, but it's a
				good practice to refer to the local <samp class="ph codeph">assert</samp> object (particularly
				when you're doing asynchronous testing).</p>

			<div class="p">Gherkin makes the <samp class="ph codeph">assert</samp> object available to you in two different ways,
				depending on whether you are using OPA5 or not. If you are using pure QUnit (no
				OPA5), then you can access the QUnit assert object inside of a step definition with
					<samp class="ph codeph">this.assert</samp>.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">this.register(/^I have launched my wombat$/i, function() {
  this.assert.strictEqual(this.myWombat.state, "launched");

			<div class="p">If you are using OPA5, then OPA5 makes the QUnit <samp class="ph codeph">assert</samp> object

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Data tables</div><div type="Data tables">
			
			<div class="p">If you want to use a large amount of structured data in your test, you can use a data table.
				In a feature file, a data table is placed underneath a test step and is composed of
				rows and columns, with rows separated by line breaks, and columns surrounded with
				the pipe (<samp class="ph codeph">|</samp>)
				character.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario: lots of data
  Given I see the following lemmings:
    | Name    | Age in Months | Role         |

    | Bob     | 70            |              |
    | Charlie | 120           | Stories      |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">In the steps file, if a data table is included in the test scenario then an extra parameter is
				passed at the end of the step definition function (after any step arguments that
				appear in the regular
				expression).<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">this.register(
  /^I see the following (.*?):$/i,
  function(sAnimalType, aDataTable) {}
);
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Data tables are usually passed to the test function as a two-dimensional array (an array of
				arrays). For example, the above feature file data table would produce the following
				array in a variable <samp class="ph codeph">aDataTable</samp> at
				runtime:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">[
  ["Name", "Age in Months", "Role"],
  ["Alice", "24", "Support"],
  ["Bob", "70", ""],
  ["Charlie", "120", "Stories"]
]
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">If the feature file data is a single row or a single column, then the test function receives a
				simple array instead of a two-dimensional
				array.<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario: lots of data

  Given I see the following lemmings:
    | Alice   |
    | Bob     |
    | Charlie |

  And I see the following lemmings:
    | Alice | Bob | Charlie |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Both test steps will provide the following runtime value for
				<samp class="ph codeph">aDataTable</samp>:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Data table utilities</div><div type="Data table utilities">
			
			<div class="p">The contents of the data table in the feature file are sent to the step definition function
				with no modifications. Although this raw format is often useful, sometimes a
				different format would be more helpful. There is a Gherkin namespace called
					<samp class="ph codeph">dataTableUtils</samp> that makes this reformatting task easy. This
				namespace provides several utilities including the function
				<samp class="ph codeph">toTable</samp>, which transforms the two-dimensional array into a simple
				array of objects. In the array of objects, each object's attribute names are derived
				from the header line in the table. For example, consider the following feature
				file:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario: lots of data
  Given I see the following lemmings:
    | Name    | Age in Months | Role         |
    | Alice   | 24            | Support      |
    | Bob     | 70            |              |
    | Charlie | 120           | Stories      |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">And the following steps
				file:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">this.register(
  /^I see the following lemmings:$/i, function(aRawData) {
    var aData = dataTableUtils.toTable(aRawData, "camelCase");
  }
);
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">In the above steps code, we ask the <samp class="ph codeph">dataTableUtils</samp> to use camel case when
				setting the names of the object attributes. (For those unfamiliar with coding
				conventions, camel case transforms the string "Hello World" into
					<samp class="ph codeph">helloWorld</samp>.) At runtime, the variable <samp class="ph codeph">aData</samp> is
				assigned the following
				value:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js"> [
  {
    ageInMonths: "24"
    name: "Alice"
    role: "Support"
  },
  {
    ageInMonths: "70"
    name: "Bob"
    role: ""
  },
  {
    ageInMonths: "120"
    name: "Charlie"
    role: "Stories"
  }
]
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">In this <samp class="ph codeph">toTable</samp> format, the data is now easier to work with. There are other transformation functions and normalization
				functions available. <span class="ph">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.test.gherkin.html" alt="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.test.gherkin.html" title="../../docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.test.gherkin.html">API Reference: <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.test.gherkin</samp></a>.</span>
				</p>

			<div class="p">If you have specialized normalization needs, you can also create your own normalization
				function. This is a function that accepts a single string parameter and returns a
				string. You could, for example, pass your custom normalization function into a
					<samp class="ph codeph">toTable</samp> call like
				this:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">var aData = dataTableUtils.toTable(aRawData, function(s) {
  return dataTableUtils.normalization.camelCase(s).replace("role", "job");
});
</pre></div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible"><div class="section_title">Scenario outlines</div><div type="Scenario outlines">
			
			<div class="p">Sometimes you need to test a repeating pattern of steps. For
				example:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario: Save 1 Lemming
  When I click on the life saving button 1 time
  Then I see Alice at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Scenario: Save 2 Lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button 2 times
  Then I see Bob at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Scenario: Save 3 Lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button 3 times
  Then I see Charlie at the end of the list of saved lemmings
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">Step arguments make it easier to implement this in the steps file, but the repetition looks
				bad and is difficult to maintain. The solution is to use a scenario outline. With a
				scenario outline, you can write the test scenarios once, Gherkin will execute the
				test as many times as you specify, for whichever input examples you have given.
				Here's how it looks in the feature
				file:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">Scenario Outline: Using a scenario outline to Save Lemmings
  When I click on the life saving button &lt;NUM CLICKS&gt; times
  Then I see &lt;NAME&gt; at the end of the list of saved lemmings

Examples: list of lemmings
  | NUM CLICKS | NAME     |
  |  1         |  Alice   |
  |  2         |  Bob     |
  |  3         |  Charlie |
</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">The above scenario outline is equivalent to writing out the three scenarios separately. In the above feature file, <samp class="ph codeph">NUM CLICKS</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">NAME</samp> are called "placeholders". At test execution, these placeholders get  replaced automatically with the values in the
				examples table. A new test scenario is generated for each row in the <samp class="ph codeph">Examples</samp> table. </p>

			<div class="p">Pay attention to the following details:<ul class="ul" id="loioa509db45afbe42678f33f5b07f4cc35b__ul_ftn_hhv_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Placeholders are case-sensitive, and can use spaces or punctuation.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Placeholders are surrounded by angle brackets (<samp class="ph codeph">&lt; &gt;</samp>) in the scenario outline steps, and without angle brackets

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Each placeholder found in the scenario outline requires a column in the <samp class="ph codeph">Examples</samp> table, with the header row holding
							the placeholders themselves.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">The examples section must be immediately after the scenario outline in the feature file.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
