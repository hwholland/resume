	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">To retrieve data from the model for visualization in the UI, the controls have to be
		bound to the model by means of a binding path. The control itself, all properties of
		controls, and all multiple aggregations can be bound to a model.</p>

		<p class="p">For binding controls to the model, several binding types exist:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio91f0d8ab6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__ul_ycp_hss_1q">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Element binding allows to bind elements to a specific object in the model data,
					which will create a binding context and allow relative binding within the
					control and all of its children. This is especially helpful in master/detail
					scenarios.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Property binding allows properties of the control to get automatically
					initialized and updated from model data. You can only bind control properties to
					model properties of a matching type, or you use a formatter function or datatype
					to convert the data as needed.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Aggregation binding can be used to automatically create child controls according
					to model data. This can be done either by cloning a template control, or by
					using a factory function. Aggregations can only be bound to lists defined in the
					model, that is, to arrays in a JSON model or a collection in the OData model.
				</p>

				<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">The model has a default size limit to avoid too much data being rendered on the UI. This size limit determines the number of entries used for the
				aggregation bindings. The default size limit is 100 entries.</p>

			<p class="p">This means that controls that don't support paging or don't request data in chunks (e.g. <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ComboBox</samp>) only show 100 entries
				even though the model contains more items.</p>

			<p class="p">To change this behavior, you can set a size limit in the model by using <samp class="ph codeph">oModel.setSizeLimit</samp>. </p>

		</div>

			</li>

		</ul>
