		<p class="p">We first introduce you to the basic development paradigms like <em class="ph i">Model-View-Controller</em> and
			establish a best-practice structure of our application. We'll do this along the classic
			example of “Hello World” and start a new app from scratch. Next, we'll introduce the
			fundamental data binding concepts of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> and extend our app
			to show a list of invoices. We'll continue to add more functionality by adding
			navigation, extending controls, and making our app responsive.Finally we'll look at the
			testing features and the built-in support tools of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>.</p>

</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="50579ddf2c934ce789e056cfffe9efa9.html" title="In this step, we replace the text with a button and show the “Hello World” message when the button is pressed.

<li><strong><a class="link" href="f665d0de4dba405f9af4294de824b03b.html" title="In OpenUI5, resources are often referred to as modules. In this step, we replace the alert from the last exercise with a proper Message Toast from the sap.m library.

</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="17b87fbafb5a4474982760d2a3a73e69.html" title="Our app content is still glued to the corners of the letterbox.

<li><strong><a class="link" href="723f4b2334e344c08269159797f6f796.html" title="Sometimes we need to define some more fine-granular layouts and this is when we can use the flexibility of CSS by adding custom style classes to controls and style them as we like.">Step 14: Custom CSS and Theme Colors</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="df8c9c3d79b54c928855162bafcd88ee.html" title="Our panel content is getting more and more complex and now it is time to move the panel content to a separate view. With that approach, the application structure is much easier to understand, and the individual parts of the app can be reused.">Step 15: Nested Views</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="4da72985139b4b83b5f1c1e0c0d2ed5a.html" title="In this step, we will take a closer look at another element which can be used to assemble views: the fragment.">Step 16: Dialogs and Fragments</a></strong><br/>

</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="776f7352807e4f82b18176c8fbdc0c56.html" title="Our dialog is still pretty much empty.

<li><strong><a class="link" href="bf71375454654b44af01379a3c3a6273.html" title="Now that we have established a good structure for our app, it's time to add some more functionality. We start exploring more features of data binding by adding some invoice data in JSON format that we display in a list below the panel.">Step 20: Aggregation Binding</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="dfe04650afc046e0802abb1a1a90d2d9.html" title="The list of invoices is already looking nice, but what is an invoice without a price assigned? Typically prices are stored in a technical format and with a '.' delimiter in the data model. For example, our invoice for pineapples has the calculated price 87.2 without a currency. We are going to use the OpenUI5 data types to format the price properly, with a locale-dependent decimal separator and two digits after the separator.">Step 21: Data Types</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="c98d57347ba444c6945f596584d2db45.html" title="Sometimes the predefined types of OpenUI5 are not flexible enough and you want to do a simple calculation or formatting in the view - that is where expressions are really helpful. We use them to format our price according to the current number in the data model.">Step 22: Expression Binding</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="0f8626ed7b7542ffaa44601828db20de.html" title="If we want to do a more complex logic for formatting properties of our data model, we can also write a custom formatting function. We will now add a localized status with a custom formatter, because the status in our data model is in a rather technical format.">Step 23: Custom Formatters</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="5295470d7eee46c1898ee46c1b9ad763.html" title="In this step, we add a search field for our product list and define a filter that represents the search term. When searching, the list is automatically updated to show only the items that match the search term.">Step 24: Filtering</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="c4b2a32bb72f483faa173e890e48d812.html" title="To make our list of invoices even more user-friendly, we sort it alphabetically instead of just showing the order from the data model. Additionally, we introduce groups and add the company that ships the products so that the data is easier to consume.">Step 25: Sorting and Grouping</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="44062441f3bd4c67a4f665ae362d1109.html" title="So far we have only worked with local JSON data, but now we will access a real OData service. Instead of implementing an own OData service we will simply use the publicly available Northwind OData service to visualize remote data. You will be surprised how little needs to be changed in order to make this work!">Step 26: Remote OData Service</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="bae9d90d2e9c4206889368f04edab508.html" title="We just ran our app against a real service, but for developing and testing our app we do not want to rely on the availability of the “real” service or put additional load on the system where the data service is located.">Step 27: Mock Server Configuration</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="e1ce1de315994a02bf162f4b3b5a9f09.html" title="Now that we have a test folder in the app, we can start to increase our test coverage.">Step 28: Unit Test with QUnit</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="9bf4dce43b7943d0909cd6c58a933589.html" title="If we want to test interaction patterns or more visual features of our app, we can also write an integration test.">Step 29: Integration Test with OPA</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="1ff250c2038849f5991209f7e6c36f1f.html" title="Even though we have added a basic test coverage in the previous steps, it seems like we accidentally broke our app, because it does not display prices to our invoices anymore. We need to debug the issue and fix it before someone finds out.">Step 30: Debugging Tools</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="e5200ee755f344c8aef8efcbab3308fb.html" title="So far, we have put all app content on one single page. As we add more and more features, we want to split the content and put it on separate pages.">Step 31: Routing and Navigation</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="2366345a94f64ec1a80f9d9ce50a59ef.html" title="We can now navigate between the overview and the detail page, but the actual item that we selected in the overview is not displayed on the detail page yet. A typical use case for our app is to show additional information for the selected item on the detail page.">Step 32: Routing with Parameters</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="8ef57cfd37b44f089f7e3b52d56597eb.html" title="Now we can navigate to our detail page and display an invoice, but we cannot go back to the overview page yet. We'll add a back button to the detail page and implement a function that shows our overview page again.">Step 33: Routing Back and History</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d12d2ee6a5454d799358d425f9e7c4db.html" title="In this step, we are going to extend the functionality of OpenUI5 with a custom control. We want to rate the product shown on the detail page, so we create a composition of multiple standard controls using the OpenUI5 extension mechanism and add some glue code to make them work nicely together. This way, we can reuse the control across the app and keep all related functionality in one module.">Step 34: Custom Controls</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="a96e18b4cd924196b255eb9623431dbb.html" title="In this step, we improve the responsiveness of our app. OpenUI5 applications can be run on phone, tablet, and desktop devices and we can configure the application to make best use of the screen estate for each scenario. Fortunately, OpenUI5 controls like the sap.m.Table already deliver a lot of features that we can use.">Step 35: Responsiveness</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d63a15e5eebb45cdada317bae5f45bc2.html" title="We now configure the visibility and properties of controls based on the device that we run the application on. By making use of the sap.ui.Device API and defining a device model we will make the app look great on many devices.">Step 36: Device Adaptation</a></strong><br/>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="link" href="d935dbf196d34997bf1ac42ac3e81579.html" title="In the last step of our Walkthrough tutorial, we adjust the content density based on the user’s device. OpenUI5 contains different content densities allowing you to display larger controls for touch-enabled devices and a smaller, more compact design for devices that are operated by mouse. In our app, we will detect the device and adjust the density accordingly.">Step 37: Content Density</a></strong><br/>
