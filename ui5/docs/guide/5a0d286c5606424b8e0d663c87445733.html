			<p class="p">An application can either specify <samp class="ph codeph">$expand</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">$select</samp> parameters to read all data to be displayed in one
				request, or create bindings dynamically to load only part of the data with one
				request per binding. The application needs to decide whether to have less roundtrips
				with more payload or more roundtrips with smaller payload. </p>

			<p class="p">Base Class that introduces some basic concepts like state management or
				databinding.</p>

			<p class="p">New subclasses of ManagedObject are created with a call to ManagedObject.extend and
				can make use of the following managed features:</p>

			<p class="p">Properties</p>

			<p class="p">Managed properties represent the state of a ManagedObject. They can store a single
				value of a simple data type (like 'string' or 'int'). They have a name (e.g. 'size')
				and methods to get the current value (getSize) or to set a new value (setSize). When
				a property is modified, the ManagedObject is marked as invalidated. A managed
				property can be bound against a property in a sap.ui.model.Model by using the
				#bindProperty method. Updates to the model property will be automatically reflected
				in the managed property and - if TwoWay databinding is active, changes to the
				managed property will be reflected in the model. An existing binding can be removed
				by calling #unbindProperty.</p>

			<p class="p">If a ManagedObject is cloned, the clone will have the same values for its managed
				properties as the source of the clone - if the property wasn't bound. If it is
				bound, the property in the clone will be bound to the same model property as in the
				source.</p>

			<p class="p">Details about the declaration of a managed property, the metadata that describes it
				and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found
				in the documentation of the extend method.</p>

			<p class="p">Aggregations</p>

			<p class="p">Managed aggregations can store one or more references to other ManagedObjects. They
				are a mean to control the lifecycle of the aggregated objects: one ManagedObject can
				be aggregated by at most one parent ManagedObject at any time. When a ManagedObject
				is destroyed, all aggregated objects are destroyed as well and the object itself is
				removed from its parent. That is, aggregations won't contain destroyed objects or
				null/undefined.</p>

			<p class="p">Aggregations have a name ('e.g 'header' or 'items'), a cardinality ('0..1' or '0..n')
				and are of a specific type (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a
				UI5 interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the aggregated
				object for a specific aggregation of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. setHeader, getHeader for
				an aggregation named 'header'). For an aggregation of cardinality 0..n, there are
				methods to get all aggregated objects (getItems), to locate an object in the
				aggregation (e.g. indexOfItem), to add, insert or remove a single aggregated object
				(addItem, insertItem, removeItem) or to remove or destroy all objects from an
				aggregation (removeAllItems, destroyItems).</p>

			<p class="p">Details about the declaration of a managed aggregation, the metadata that describes
				it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be
				found in the documentation of the extend method.</p>

			<p class="p">Aggregations of cardinality 0..n can be bound to a collection in a model by using
				#bindAggregation (and unbound again using #unbindAggregation). For each context in
				the model collection, a corresponding object will be created in the managed
				aggregation, either by cloning a template object or by calling a factory
				function.</p>

			<p class="p">Aggregations also control the databinding context of bound objects: by default,
				aggregated objects inherit all models and binding contexts from their parent
				object.</p>

			<p class="p">When a ManagedObject is cloned, all aggregated objects will be cloned as well - but
				only if they haven't been added by databinding. In that case, the aggregation in the
				clone will be bound to the same model collection.</p>

			<p class="p">Associations</p>

			<p class="p">Managed associations also form a relationship between objects, but they don't define
				a lifecycle for the associated objects. They even can 'break' in the sense that an
				associated object might have been destroyed already although it is still referenced
				in an association. For the same reason, the internal storage for associations are
				not direct object references but only the IDs of the associated target objects.</p>

			<p class="p">Associations have a name ('e.g 'initialFocus'), a cardinality ('0..1' or '0..n') and
				are of a specific type (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5
				interface). A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the associated object
				for a specific association of cardinality 0..1 (e.g. setInitialFocus,
				getInitialFocus). For an association of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get
				all associated objects (getRefItems), to add, insert or remove a single associated
				object (addRefItem, insertRefItem, removeRefItem) or to remove all objects from an
				association (removeAllRefItems).</p>

			<p class="p">Details about the declaration of a managed association, the metadata that describes
				it and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be
				found in the documentation of the extend method.</p>

			<p class="p">Associations can't be bound to the model.</p>

			<p class="p">When a ManagedObject is cloned, the result for an association depends on the
				relationship between the associated target object and the root of the clone
				operation: if the associated object is part of the to-be-cloned object tree
				(reachable via aggregations from the root of the clone operation), then the cloned
				association will reference the clone of the associated object. Otherwise it will
				reference the same object as in the original tree. When a ManagedObject is
				destroyed, other objects that are only associated, are not affected by the destroy
				operation.</p>

			<p class="p">Events</p>

			<p class="p">Managed events provide a mean for communicating important state changes to an
				arbitrary number of 'interested' listeners. Events have a name and (optionally) a
				set of parameters. For each event there will be methods to add or remove an event
				listener as well as a method to fire the event. (e.g. attachChange, detachChange,
				fireChange for an event named 'change').</p>

			<p class="p">Details about the declaration of a managed events, the metadata that describes it and
				the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in
				the documentation of the extend method.</p>

			<p class="p">When a ManagedObject is cloned, all listeners registered for any event in the clone
				source are also registered to the clone. Later changes are not reflected in any
				direction (neither from source to clone nor vice versa).</p>

			<p class="p">Low Level APIs:</p>

			<p class="p">The prototype of ManagedObject provides several generic, low level APIs to manage
				properties, aggregations, associations and events. These generic methods are solely
				intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single
				managed property etc. (e.g. a function setSize(value) that sets a new value for
				property 'size'). sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend creates default implementations
				of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation of a subclass
				then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation,
				e.g. to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is
				therefore important to understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT
				SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed object, as that would bypass
				the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.</p>

			<p class="p">To reduce payload, applications should only select properties that are needed using
					<samp class="ph codeph">$select</samp> (see the code sample in the <a class="xref" href="54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d.html#loio54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d__section_Parameters">Parameters</a> section under <a class="xref" href="54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d.html" title="Bindings connect OpenUI5 view elements to model data, allowing changes in the model to be reflected in the view element and vice versa.">Bindings</a>). Besides the properties needed
				on the UI, the binding must select key properties to support features such as read
				requests sent from a child binding, write requests, or bound operations on the
				respective entity.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Batching Requests or Not</div><div type="Batching Requests or Not">
			
			<p class="p">By default, the OData V4 model collects all requests made to the OData service in a batch
				request to reduce the number of roundtrips. The disadvantage of a batch request is
				that it cannot be cached by the browser. If some of the requests (e.g. value help
				requests) are "cacheable", it is a good idea to request these resources directly and
				use the browser cache to improve the performance of the application. In such cases,
				use the <samp class="ph codeph">$direct</samp> group as described in the section <a class="xref" href="74142a38e3d4467c8d6a70b28764048f.html" title="OData V4 allows you to group multiple operations into a single HTTP request payload, as described in the official OData V4 specification Part 1, Batch Requests (see the link under Related Information for more details).">Batch Control</a>.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Binding Caches</div><div type="Binding Caches">
			
			<p class="p">Absolute bindings and also relative bindings, which fulfill certain conditions, have a cache
				that is used for their data. Once data is read, all value requests (e.g. those made
				by dependent relative bindings) are served by this cached data.
					<samp class="ph codeph">ODataListBinding</samp> additionally supports paging. For more
				information about this, see <a class="xref" href="54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d.html" title="Bindings connect OpenUI5 view elements to model data, allowing changes in the model to be reflected in the view element and vice versa.">Bindings</a>. </p>

			<p class="p">Calling <samp class="ph codeph">refresh</samp> on an absolute binding clears its cache as well as the caches
				of its relative child bindings. Calling <samp class="ph codeph">refresh</samp> on the model
				refreshes all bindings that have been created by that model. </p>

			<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
				<p class="p">Relative bindings that  have an own cache store cache by context. When you change the context
					of the relative binding and then switch back to the previous context, the latter
					context change will not lead to a data request as the cache holding this data is
					reused. This is useful for master-detail scenarios where selection in the master
					leads to setting the corresponding context in the relative binding for the
					detail. Entries in the master that have already been selected won't lead to a
					data request.</p>

				<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Note:</span> For the above mechanism to work, you must not recreate
					a relative binding as you then lose the cache for the previously selected
					contexts. Keep the binding and just set its context.</p>
