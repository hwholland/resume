<div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Commit Summary</p>

				<p class="p">The summary should be 50-70 characters long.</p>

				<p class="p">The summary line must be prefixed with either <samp class="ph codeph">[FIX]</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">[FEATURE]</samp>, which should be followed by the control
					or component that is the main subject of the change.</p>

				<p class="p">Instead of <samp class="ph codeph">[FIX]</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">[FEATURE]</samp> and at any other location in the commit message, you can use
						<samp class="ph codeph">[INTERNAL]</samp> for commits or explanations which should not be part of the change log. If you add
						<samp class="ph codeph">[INTERNAL]</samp> as only prefix to the commit message, the entire message won't be part of the change log. If you add this
					prefix to the middle of the message, everything after this prefix will be ignored for the change log.</p>

				<p class="p">Do not use any <samp class="ph codeph">[</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">]</samp> within the summary but for the prefixes.</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Description</p>

				<p class="p">Describe the problem you fix with this change. Whether your patch is a one-line bug fix or 5000 lines of a new feature, there must be an
					underlying problem that motivated you to do this work. Make the necessity of the fix clear to the reviewers, so they will continue
					reading.</p>

				<p class="p">Describe the effect that this change has from a user's point of view. App crashes and lockups are pretty convincing for example, but not all
					bugs are that obvious and should be mentioned in the text. Even if the problem was spotted during code review, describe the impact you think
					it can have on users.</p>

				<p class="p">After that, describe the technical details of what you changed. It is important to describe the change in a most understandable way so the
					reviewer is able to verify that the code is behaving as you intend it to.</p>

- Now the normal invalidation is used and Popup.js takes care of the
