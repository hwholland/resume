		<p class="p">As a control developer, you create or modify UI libraries and their pieces, i.e. controls and types. You define the set of properties your control
			provides as well as events or aggregations. A major task is the implementation of a control-specific renderer, which knows how to create suitable
			HTML markup for a given control instance, taking its current state into account. A renderer is written in JavaScript and produces HTML output which
			is styled by means of CSS. Such style sheets are another important part of a UI library.</p>
