	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"/>

		<p class="p">The app can load controls (usually views) in the three columns with the standard means
				(<samp class="ph codeph">beginColumnPages</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">midColumnPages</samp>,
				<samp class="ph codeph">endColumnPages</samp> aggregations) and navigate between them with the
				<samp class="ph codeph">.to()</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">.backToPage()</samp> or any other public method,
			similar to the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.NavContainer</samp> or
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitContainer</samp> controls.</p>

		<p class="p">At the same time, the app can change the layout of the control by modifying the
				<samp class="ph codeph">layout</samp> property.</p>

		<p class="p">If both a layout change and the loading of a new view need to happen as a result of one user
			action, the best practice is to change the layout first, and to load the views (or
			navigate to already loaded views) second. This would ensure that the columns are resized
			first (as layout change is done synchronously), and only then views are placed inside
			the already resized columns. This would eliminate the need for controls in the views to
			readapt to the new size after they are placed and rendered initially.</p>
