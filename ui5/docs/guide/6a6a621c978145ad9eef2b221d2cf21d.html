		<p class="p">We will use the worklist template as a starting point for this tutorial and add

			<div class="p">You can do this tutorial either with <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span> or choose your own
				development environment:<ul class="ul" id="loio6a6a621c978145ad9eef2b221d2cf21d__ul_ykf_mlp_zt">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If you use <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>, you don't need to set up a development environment, a server and so
							on. All you need is a browser and an account for the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.
							If you don't have an account yet, you can easily get a trial account. We
							recommend to continue with the <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span> as it has
							out-of-the-box support for <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> and
							because there is no setup overhead at all.</p>

						<p class="p">In this case, you start with the template that is available in SAP Web
							IDE as described in option 1 for step 1 of this tutorial (see <a class="xref" href="0c5dc937271f4f56b5e7d54676199860.html" title="This first step is only relevant if you decided to use the SAP Web IDE. In this step, we will set up the worklist app using a template and configure the service to display products in the app. The template includes generic app functionality and tests that can be easily extended with custom functionality for our use case.">Step 1 (Option 1): Creating the Initial App with an App Template in SAP Web IDE</a>).</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If you want to use your local development environment and deploy to any
							Web server of your choice, you download the code for step 1 from the
							Demo Kit <span class="ph">at <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist/samples" alt="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist/samples" title="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.m.tutorial.worklist/samples">Worklist App</a></span>. In this case, start
							with option 2 for step 1 of this tutorial (see <a class="xref" href="9d646de79e3a46ee8143a4b21b332e5e.html" title="In this step, we set up the initial app without SAP Web IDE.">Step 1 (Option 2): Downloading the Code</a>).</p>

			<p class="p">There might be some small differences between the worklist app code generated by the SAP Web
				IDE template and the code downloaded from the Demo Kit. However, the differences are
				small and not relevant for the purpose of this tutorial</p>

			<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
				<p class="p">You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step
