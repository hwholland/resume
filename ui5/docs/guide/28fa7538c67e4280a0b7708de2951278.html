	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Create a neo-app.json Project Configuration File</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The <span class="ph filepath">neo-app.json</span> file contains all project settings for <span class="ph pname">SAP
			Web IDE</span> and is created in the root folder of your project. It is a JSON format
		file consisting of multiple configuration keys. The most important setting for you to
		configure is the path where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime is located when
		starting the app.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<p class="p">You do this using the “routes” key and defining an array of resource objects. For running an
					<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> tutorial,
				you only need two entries - one that configures <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> to be available
				with the path <span class="ph filepath">/resources</span>, and another one that configures the
				test resources needed for the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span> integration with the
				path <span class="ph filepath">/test-resources</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">Create two configuration objects that contain a <samp class="ph codeph">path</samp>, a
					<samp class="ph codeph">target</samp>, and a <samp class="ph codeph">description</samp> attribute with more
				configuration settings. The <samp class="ph codeph">path</samp> and the <samp class="ph codeph">entryPath</samp>
				values will point to the location on the server where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> resources will
				be stored.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span> reads these settings
				automatically when running the app. You can see the whole configuration file in the
				code block below. Optionally, you can add the key <samp class="ph codeph">welcomeFile</samp> to
				configure the entry point to your app. In web applications, this is typically the
					<span class="ph filepath">index.html</span> file.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">Depending on which <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span> version
					you are using, you might have to configure the project to run against the
					"snapshot" version of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, otherwise
					the application will be launched with the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> release that
					is delivered with <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>. This is usually the latest version that is released publicly to
					customers.</p>

				<p class="p">You can check which version of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is loaded by
					opening the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
					debugging tools with <span class="keys">
						<kbd class="key">CTRL</kbd>
						 + <kbd class="key">SHIFT</kbd>
						 + <kbd class="key">ALT</kbd>
						 + <kbd class="key">P</kbd>
					</span>. If the version is too old for certain features of the tutorial, you
					have to add the <samp class="ph codeph">version</samp> attribute to the target configuration
					entry and set the value to <samp class="ph codeph">snapshot</samp>.</p>
