			<p class="p">Before you start developing apps with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, you start by
				setting up the development environment of your choice. You can find our
				recommendations under <a class="xref" href="7bb04e05f9484e1b95b38a2e48ecef4f.html" title="This part of the documentation gives you guidance on the most common and recommended use cases of the installation, configuration and setup of the UI development toolkit for HTML5 (OpenUI5) development environment.">Development Environment</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">After that, you define the project setup. If you work in a team, we recommend using a
				continuous integration setup as described under <a class="xref" href="fe7a158313af4590ad60f844e5b43b80.html" title="This section describes the setup of a development project where multiple developers work together on the same code.">Continuous Integration: Ensure Code Quality</a>.

			<p class="p">When faced with developing an app, you have several ways to get started ranging from
				app templates or a make-em-completely-from-scratch approach. But which approach is
				right for your situation? In most cases, it's your level of expertise or need for
				flexibility and freedom that will decide.</p>

			<p class="p">Think of the app templates described in this section as a kind of best practice for
				app development. They incorporate our latest recommendations and can be used as a
				starting point for developing apps according to the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori design guidelines</span>. They
				include generic application functionality and tests that can be easily extended with
				custom functionality if needed. There are separate templates for Worklist and
				Master-Detail application patterns, and we have an empty basic template. The
				templates are described under <a class="xref" href="a460a7348a6c431a8bd967ab9fb8d918.html" title="The app templates documented here are a kind of &#34;best practice&#34; for your app development.">App Templates: Kick Start Your App Development</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">If you're skilled at coding and want the freedom and flexibility, you can build an
				app completely from scratch. In the chapters in this section, you will find some
				guidance on how to deal with crucial concepts such as accessibility, security,
				device adaptation.</p>

			<p class="p">Be sure to check out information about things that you really should avoid doing
				while coding: <a class="xref" href="387787232c214b42954f18c93a28560a.html" title="This section lists some of the most important issues that should be avoided when creating applications using OpenUI5, split into different categories for reasons of simplicity.">Coding Issues to Avoid</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">How you deploy your app when you're finished depends on the tools you use and the platform
				where your app is going to run. See the related documentation for details.</p>
