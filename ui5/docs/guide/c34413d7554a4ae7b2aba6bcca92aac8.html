</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Check if you have used a custom CSS in your app. </p>
<p class="p">If you have used a custom CSS, it is probably interfering with the styling in the standard <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> theming libraries. </p>
<p class="p">Use the developer tools of your browser to inspect the element that has the wrong styling. In the HTML tab, you can usually see which styles are applied to a DOM element. If you have styles in the list that are added by your app, disable these styles in the debugger to see whether this solves the problem.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> <p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>-specific CSS classes and IDs all have an <samp class="ph codeph">sapUi</samp> prefix, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">sapUiButton</samp>. </p>
</div>
<p class="p">If this does not solve the issue, check for inline styles that are applied to the element in the HTML code. You can also try to isolate the control from the app to see whether there is an issue with the control instead of a collision of styles.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Check whether the theme you that you are using is supported in combination with the libraries that you are using in your app. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="38ff8c27b022475a92b591bcf6262551.html" title="This chapter gives an overview of the possible combinations of themes and libraries for the OpenUI5 versions that are still in maintenance.">Supported Combinations of Themes and Libraries</a> and <a class="xref" href="a87ca843bcee469f82a9072927a7dcdb.html" title="As OpenUI5 evolves over time, some of the UI controls are replaced by others, or their concepts abandoned entirely.
