	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In this tutorial, we will explore some advanced features of the mock server. </p>

		<p class="p">If no OData service is available or you simply don’t want to depend on the OData backend
			connectivity for your development and tests, the mock server can mimic the OData
			back-end calls. It is designed to simulate an OData provider by intercepting the HTTP
			communication made to the server, and providing a fake output. All this is transparent
			to the data binding and usage of OData model.</p>

		<p class="p">In certain scenarios, using only the built-in OData simulation of the mock server is
			insufficient for completely server-independent tests. For example, if your application
			is using an OData feature that is not supported by the mock server, or if your
			application invokes a function import that depends on server specific implementation
			(and thus is also not simulated generically). We will demonstrate how to use function
			callbacks in order to change existing mock requests.</p>

		<p class="p">Additionally, we will demonstrate how to mock an additional request that is not simulated out
			of the box by the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
			mock server.</p>

		<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
			<p class="p">The tutorial describes how to use some advanced features of the mock server, disregarding the
				legal aspects of shipping mock data. Usually the mock data and mock server
				invocation is done in a test folder that is not shipped to customers. Be very
				careful that you don't ship mock data!</p>
