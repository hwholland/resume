		(mobile, desktop, tablet). </p>

		
		<p class="p">For example, the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Carousel</samp> control shows the left and right navigation
			buttons in addition to gesture only when it runs on desktop. The distinction between
			desktop and mobile behaviors should be done by checking
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.Device.system.desktop</samp> but NOT
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.Device.support.touch</samp> because desktop browser can also
			support touch, for example Windows 8 touch-enabled device.</p>

		<p class="p"> A property <samp class="ph codeph">combi</samp> is provided in <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.Device.support</samp> with
			which you can tell that the browser supports both touch and mouse interfaces.</p>

		<p class="p">Not all browser on Windows 8 touch-enabled device support touch events. Some browser
			fires mouse events when user operates with finger. Since those mouse events are not
			marked with <samp class="ph codeph">_sapui_delayedMouseEvents</samp>, they can still be handled with
			<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> event delegation and the registered handler.</p>
