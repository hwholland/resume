	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">With behavior-driven development (BDD), you as a developer start with a user story that defines the business value that the developed app should
		have. Next, you write a test that verifies the new functionality (this test initially fails). Finally, you write the needed functionality and your test
		passes. Gherkin is a test framework that supports this approach. </p>

		<p class="p">At first, as you are learning BDD, it will take a long time to implement new tests. Resist the temptation to abandon automated testing. The most important
			software development phase for successful software is the maintenance phase. Automated tests are the best way to ensure an effective maintenance
			phase, and help ensure that the code quality remains high over time.</p>

		<p class="p">It's true that when you first try automated testing it might take a long time, but even this first attempt will be worthwhile and pay dividends later. In
			your future projects, when you implement your tests much faster, your initial investment in learning how to do integration testing will really pay
			off.</p>

		<p class="p">One good way to ensure that you get the most value for your investment of time into automated testing is to ensure that you test the right things.
			Integration testing is best for testing the main path of the major business scenarios. These are what are called "face-saving tests", in the sense
			that you will lose face if you try to deliver the software when these major business scenarios are failing. Hence, integration tests are a great way
			to do a quick and painless smoke test every time you commit a change to your software, to ensure that you haven't broken anything important.</p>

		<p class="p">Since writing integration tests can be time-consuming, it's better to use unit testing to test all of the nuances and failure cases of your software. Unit
			tests are cheap and easy to write, and are better suited to achieving full test coverage for the software. </p>

			<p class="p">Gherkin is written in JavaScript and is fully compatible with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, OPA, and QUnit. It is
				based on the <span class="q">“cucumber”</span> tool.</p>

			<div class="p">The advantages of using Gherkin are:<ul class="ul" id="loio45ac9f19d9414b30b121c6e00f57433c__ul_rlj_gnn_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">You write executable specifications that are easy to understand and that allow the easy generation of integration tests.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Product specification and documentation are <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">always up to date</span>; they evolve during the development project.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Single source of truth: Reduce communication errors across your development team, because the product owner, developers, and testers are all working
							from the same specification.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Maximize the business value you get out of the time spent writing tests, and keep your focus on the customer and their requirements.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>

			<div class="p">The Gherkin library contains the following parts:<ul class="ul" id="loio45ac9f19d9414b30b121c6e00f57433c__ul_iz2_h4n_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Feature file</p>

						<div class="p">Software specification written in Gherkin syntax. Feature files are human-readable

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Steps file</p>

						<div class="p">Translates the feature file into something a computer can understand and execute. The steps
