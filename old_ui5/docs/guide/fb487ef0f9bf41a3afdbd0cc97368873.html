			<p class="p">OPA <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> parameter is available as of version 1.48. It is a good
				practice to enable it in your tests. By default, it is not enabled in order to keep
				old tests running.</p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> synchronizes test execution with the app. No interactions are
				attempted while the app is performing asynchronous work. This will increase the
				probability that OPA statements succeed as they will only be executed when the app
				is ready to respond.</p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is used:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__ul_rlg_rxj_wbb">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">When you retrieve a control with the intent to perform an action on it</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">For every control search, when you explicitly set <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp>
						to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp></p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is applied before searching for a control, which means
				before OPA check functions and matchers. If there is no work to await, the controls
				will be retrieved, then actions will be executed on them and lastly the success
				function will be called. If there is still pending work, matchers, actions and
				success function will be skipped and OPA will retry the check until it succeeds or a
				timeout is reached.</p>

			<p class="p">Success functions are only called when controls are found, their state is valid and the app is
				responsive. It is recommended to use actions rather than the success function when
				interacting with a control. This will ensure that the interaction itself is
				performed properly and also that the app is in a state that allows the interaction
				to be executed.</p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> covers several types of asynchronous work:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__ul_qnb_5yj_wbb">
				<li class="li">Delayed work set with timeout and immediate</li>

				<li class="li">XHR requests created using XMLHttpRequests and sinon.FakeXMLHttpRequests</li>

				<li class="li">Native promises created with <samp class="ph codeph">resolve</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">all</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">race</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">reject</samp> functions</li>

				<li class="li">UI navigation of parent containers</li>

				<li class="li">UIArea rerendering</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">Enabling <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> ensures that the controls and their parents are
				visible, enabled and not busy and also that the controls are not hidden behind
				static elements, such as dialogs.</p>

			<p class="p">If your app still has ongoing asynchronous work when the OPA timeout is reached, the
				test will fail. The test failure message will include details of the last detected
				work before the timeout. This type of OPA timeouts are usually caused by test
				instability. When writing a huge set of tests and executing them frequently, you
				might notice some tests that fail sporadically. Setting <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> to
					<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp> should stabilize most of these tests.</p>

			<p class="p">If you decide to follow the best practices and enable <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp>, it
				is recommended to do it only once in your code, near your tests' starting point and
				then disable it per <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> statement where needed. This will help
				you to avoid confusion when debugging test failures.</p>

			<p class="p">Example:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">// in QUnit start page, before all OPA tests
Opa5.extendConfig({
    autoWait: true
});
// in an OPA test
oOpa.waitFor({
    id: "myControlID",
    success: function (oControl) {
        Opa5.assert.ok(!oControl.getBusy(), "My control was not busy");
    }
});
// and then in a special waitFor case which requires a control to be non-interactable
oOpa.waitFor({
    autoWait: false,
    id: "myControlID",
    success: function (oControl) {
        // now you can explicitly check for some blocking condition
        Opa5.assert.ok(oControl.getBusy(), "My control was busy");
    }
})</pre></div>

			<p class="p">If you decide to start using <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> in your existing tests, the
				easiest way to migrate is to extend OPA config by enabling
				<samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp>, run the tests to see if any <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp>
				statements time out and then disable <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> specifically for
				them.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loiofb487ef0f9bf41a3afdbd0cc97368873__section_efn_nnn_2cb"><div class="section_title">autoWait and App Startup</div><div type="autoWait and App Startup">
			
			<p class="p">Usually, there is a lot of time-consuming work done on app startup which can make the
				entire app noninteractive for a long time.</p>

			<p class="p">To ensure that OPA doesn't timeout before the app is fully loaded, the timeout for
					<samp class="ph codeph">iStartMyAppInAFrame</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">iStartMyUIComponent</samp> is
				increased to the default of 80 seconds.</p>

			<p class="p">Despite the increase, there are still some tests that timeout. The timeout usually
				occurs during the first test step, which can be misleading regarding the actual
				cause of failure. <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> is recommended in such cases but it is
				disabled during startup to prevent issues with module loading during app launcher
				initialization.</p>

			<p class="p">As of version 1.54, the optional use of <samp class="ph codeph">autoWait</samp> after launcher
				initialization is allowed to make sure the app is loaded before the first test step.
				It is disabled by default for backward compatibility as some tests check for busy
				indicators on app start. You can use the option with both app launchers, for
				example:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">Given.iStartMyAppInAFrame({
    source: "applicationUnderTest/index.html",
    autoWait: true
});</pre></div>
