	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Handling Events in XML Views</h1>

	
	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">XML views use event handlers as attributes: The attribute name is the event name, such
		as "press" for a button, and the attribute value is the event handler name.</p>

		<p class="p">Depending on the syntax of its name, the event handler will be looked up by this name in
			different locations:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loiob0fb4de7364f4bcbb053a99aa645affe__ul_yjb_f42_hq">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Names starting with a dot ('.') are always assumed to represent a method in the
					controller. They are resolved by removing the leading dot and reading the
					property with the resulting name from the controller instance. These names are
					'relative' to the view/controller. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">press:
						".myLocalHandler"</samp> is resolved by <samp class="ph codeph">
						attachPress(oController["myLocalHandler"], oController);</samp></p>

				<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> This syntax is by intention consistent to the complex binding syntax for
					formatter functions.</div>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Names containing a dot at a later position are assumed to represent global
					functions and are resolved by calling <samp class="ph codeph">jQuery.sap.getObject</samp> with
					the full name. For example, name <samp class="ph codeph">press: "some.global.handler"</samp>
					is resolved by calling
						<samp class="ph codeph">attachPress(jQuery.sap.getObject("some.global.handler"),
						oController);</samp></p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Names without dot are interpreted as a relative name; if nothing is found, they
					are interpreted as an absolute name. This variant is only supported for backward
					compatibility. Example:</p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">press: "myHandler" --&gt; if ( oController["myHandler"] ) {
  attachPress(oController["myHandler"], oController);
} else {
  attachPress(jQuery.sap.getObject("myHandler"), oController);
}</pre></div>

			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">Irrespective of where the function was looked up, it will be executed with the controller
			as the context object (<samp class="ph codeph">this</samp>). This is also true for global event
			handlers and makes the implementation of generic global handlers easier that may need an
			easy way back to the controller/view in which they are actually used, for example, to
			call <samp class="ph codeph">createId</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">byId</samp>. This should make the
			development of global event handlers more consistent with controller local event
			handlers.</p>

		<p class="p">Therefore, the following declaration is equivalent to a call of
				<samp class="ph codeph">controller.doSomething()</samp> when the button is pressed:</p>

		<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-xml">
...
          &lt;Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething"/&gt;
... </pre></div>

	</div>

</div></div>
