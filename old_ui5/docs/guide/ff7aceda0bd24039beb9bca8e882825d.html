	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The application cache buster (short <samp class="ph codeph">AppCacheBuster</samp>) is similar to the cache buster but is used for application
		resources.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> supports the
				application cache buster on <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP</span> only.</p>

			<p class="p">For Java apps on the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> you can
				enable it by including server-side components which are not available
				externally.</p>

			<p class="p">For Java apps on <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                Java</span> and <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS the
				application cache buster concept is <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> supported.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="p">Applications provide an index file named <span class="ph filepath">sap-ui-cachebuster-info.json</span> (created on the fly) containing the last modified timestamps of
			all included files (like scripts, properties, or any other file that we load via XHR programmatically). Technically this file is a mapping between
			the request path (below the context path of the application) and the last modified time stamp. </p>

		<p class="p">The server instructs the client to cache all the above resources (not using the 304/not modified mechanism). For the index file we are using the 304/not
			modified mechanism to avoid to load when it has not been changed. </p>

		<p class="p">On the client side, we initially load this file of the application when enabled via configuration option <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-appcachebuster</samp> and use
			this for the XHR requests. If the request path is contained in the above mentioned index file we simply add the time stamp as leading path segment
			to this request. If the time stamp doesn’t change the URL is unique and therefore it will be taken from cache. Once the file is modified the URL
			parameter will be changed and therefore loaded again from the back end. </p>

		<p class="p">The server has to delete the time stamp from this URL to look up the file properly. For <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP</span>, the logic is implemented in the ICF handler. Both back end implementations,
				<span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                Java</span> and <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver AS for
                                ABAP</span>, also generate the index file on-the-fly. </p>

		<div class="p">
			<div class="note note" id="loioff7aceda0bd24039beb9bca8e882825d__note_N1002B_N10028_N10011_N10001"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> The application cache buster does <strong class="ph b">not</strong> work across application borders. If you require resources from
				another application they are not loaded via this mechanism.</div>
