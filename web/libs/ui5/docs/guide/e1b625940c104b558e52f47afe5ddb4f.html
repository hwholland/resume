			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> provides the
				following predefined models: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="loioe1b625940c104b558e52f47afe5ddb4f__ul_isr_ltw_qk">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">OData model</span>: Enables binding of controls to data from
						OData services. The OData model supports two-way (default), one-way and
						one-time binding modes. However, two-way binding is currently only supported
						for properties, and not for aggregations.</p>

					<div class="p">
						<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
							<p class="p">The OData model currently supports the following OData versions:</p>

							<ul class="ul" id="loioe1b625940c104b558e52f47afe5ddb4f__ul_xyj_pdk_qx">
								<li class="li">
									<p class="p">OData V2</p>

								</li>

								<li class="li">OData V4 (limited feature scope)</li>

							</ul>

						</div>

					</div>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">JSON model</span>: Can be used to bind controls to JavaScript
						object data, which is usually serialized in the JSON format. The JSON model
						is a client-side model and, therefore, intended for small data sets, which
						are completely available on the client. The JSON model supports two-way
						(default), one-way and one-time binding modes.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">XML model</span>: A client-side model intended for small data
						sets, which are completely available on the client. The XML model does not
						contain mechanisms for server-based paging or loading of deltas. The XML
						model supports two-way (default), one-way and one-time binding modes.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Resource model</span>: Designed to handle data in resource
						bundles, mainly to provide texts in different languages. The resource model
						only supports one-time binding mode because it deals with static texts
						only.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
<p class="p">The JSON model, XML model, and the resource model are <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">client-side
					models</span>, meaning that the model data is loaded completely and is
				available on the client. Operations such as sorting and filtering are executed on
				the client without further server requests. </p>
<p class="p">The OData (V2 or V4) model is a
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">server-side model</span> and only loads the data requested by the
				user interface from the server.</p>
<p class="p">You can not only define one model for your
				applications, but define different areas in your application with different models
				and assign single controls to a model. You can also define nested models, for
				example, a JSON model defined for the application and an OData model for a table
				control contained in the application. </p>
<p class="p">A Web application should support
				several data sources, such as JSON, XML, Atom, or OData. However, the way in which
				data binding is defined and implemented within the UI controls should be independent
				of the respective data source. It is also possible to create a custom model
				implementation for data sources that are not yet covered by the framework or are
				domain-specific.</p>
