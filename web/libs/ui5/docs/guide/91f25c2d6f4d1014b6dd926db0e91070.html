<h1 class="title topictitle1">File Names and Locations (View and Controller)</h1>

	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">In <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, controllers and
		views are defined and instantiated via a name that equals an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> module name within the
		define/require concept.</p>
<p class="p">By default, all files have to be located in a subfolder of the <samp class="ph codeph">resources</samp> folder
			of the Web application. If this location is not appropriate, deviations can be
			configured as described in the following example: </p>
<p class="p">The following example assumes that your views and controllers are located on your local machine
				where the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime is loaded from another machine. When you instantiate a view or
				a controller, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime loads them in relation to the <samp class="ph codeph">resources</samp>
				folder of the machine where <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime was loaded. To inform <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> runtime that
			your views and controllers are located on your local machine, use the following code: </p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">jQuery.sap.registerModulePath(sModuleNamePrefix, sURL);</pre></div>
<p class="p">or 
	 </p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
sap.ui.localResources(sModuleNamePrefix);</pre></div>
<p class="p">It is usually sufficient to use 
		<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.localResources</samp>
		which internally registers 
		<samp class="ph codeph">sModuleNamePrefix</samp> to the
		URL 
		<samp class="ph codeph">"./" + sTransformedModuleNamePrefix</samp>, where all dots are replaced by slashes
		in the transformed name. All files starting with 
		<samp class="ph codeph">sModuleNamePrefix</samp> will
		then be loaded in relation to the location of the HTML page that called 
		<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.localResources</samp>. 
	 </p>
<p class="p">If your files are located at <samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;localhost:8080&gt;/&lt;myapp&gt;/</samp>, for
			example, you can use <samp class="ph codeph">registerModulePath</samp> as follows: </p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
jQuery.sap.registerModulePath("myapp", "http://&lt;localhost:8080&gt;/&lt;myapp&gt;/");</pre></div>
<p class="p">or 
	 </p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
sap.ui.localResources("myapp");</pre></div>
<p class="p">All views and controllers with a name starting with 
		<samp class="ph codeph">myapp</samp>, for example 
		<samp class="ph codeph">myapp.MyView</samp>, will then
		be loaded from your local machine.
