	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Browser security comprises several topics such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking,
		and local storage.</p>
<p class="p">A browser is, by design, an untrusted client: A server cannot rely on any information sent from a
			browser, as a malicious user can use a JavaScript debugger to tamper with the client
			code, or a proxy server like fiddler to modify request data. Input validation on the
			client is just for convenience purposes as the server always has to validate the data
			again that is received from the client.</p>
<p class="p">Browsers also offer possible attack vectors, such as Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS). The application
			has to take care of these. </p>
<div class="section" id="loio91f3b66b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__section_6C7CB6E84E7E42DB821D50A02BEFF849"><div class="section_title">Cross-Site Scripting</div><div type="Cross-Site Scripting"> 
		 
		<p class="p">Cross-Site-Scripting has become the most prominent security issue of web applications within
				the last years and also the most dangerous one, as it allows several ways of
				exploitation. Once malicious code is running within your browser, it can be used to
				steal your session cookies, to trigger requests within the current session, or even
				to exploit a known browser vulnerability to do native code execution. </p>
 
				<p class="p">For <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> applications, XSS vulnerabilities can
		  exist on different levels: 
		</p>
 
		<ul class="ul"><li class="li"> 
			 <p class="p">Within the HTML page or custom data transports
				sent to the browser from the server 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
<li class="li"> 
			 <p class="p">Within the JavaScript code of the application, which is processing server responses </p>
 
		  </li>
<li class="li"> 
		  	<p class="p">Within the HTML renderers of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> controls 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
</ul>
 
				<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> can only prevent
				cross-site scripting in the processing and rendering of controls. For that purpose,
				input validation exists for all typed element properties and output encoding is done
				in the renderer class of controls. However, there are exceptions for controls that
				are especially built to include arbitrary HTML, for example,
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.HTML</samp>.</p>
 
		<div class="p">The application is responsible for the following tasks:<ul class="ul" id="loio91f3b66b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__ul_sks_jyc_qr">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Proper output encoding of all content embedded in the HTML page
							itself</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Encoding JSON or XML data sent to the client</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Secure processing of the JSON/XML data</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Security of custom controls provided by the application</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>

This page does not provide general information about cross-site scripting but focuses on what you as an application developer using OpenUI5 can do to avoid these security issues.">Cross-Site Scripting</a>.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Clickjacking</div><div type="Clickjacking">
			
			<p class="p">Clickjacking, or UI redressing, tricks the user into triggering actions within an application
				by redirecting clicks. This is done, for example, by using an invisible iFrame that
				is positioned above a fake UI. When the user clicks on something on the fake UI, the
				content of the invisible iFrame handles the click.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> provides a way to prevent
				clickjacking since version 1.28.0. This has to be configured, as needed, by the
				application. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="62d9c4d8f5ad49aa914624af9551beb7.html" title="frameOptions is used to prevent security vulnerabilities like clickjacking. With the frameOptions configuration you define whether OpenUI5 is allowed to run embedded in a frame or only from trusted origins or not at all.">Frame Options</a>. </p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> As of version 1.28.0, you no longer need to use the Business Add-In
					<samp class="ph codeph">/UI5/BADI_CONFIG_HTTP_HANDLER</samp> to configure the X-Frame-Options
				response header (SAP Note 2075016). The <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> framework now
				handles clickjacking prevention and the add-in solution won't work on all browsers. </div>

			<p class="p">HTML5 offers a lot of new functionality, which also brings a lot of potential new
				security issues. This is just an overview of some of the new features and possible
				security issues when they are used. </p>

		<div class="sectiondiv" id="section_28FDB6AF8A8446FA9B40EFC0DEED90D8"> 
			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Local Storage</span></p>
 
		<p class="p">All browsers are now offering a local storage API.
		  This API can be used to store a limited amount of data on the browser. Access
		  to this data is limited to JavaScript code running from the same domain as it
		  has been stored. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> offers helper functions to access the local storage on
		  different browsers. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">The local storage of browsers is not a secure
		  storage, so while it can be used for static data, like enumerations,
		  applications must not store any user or application data within the local
		  storage. 
		</p>
 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is using the local storage of the browser
		  for the history-capability of dropdown boxes and combo boxes. 
		</p>
 
	 </div><div class="sectiondiv" id="section_E81EA53C91814771BF17EDD4352DE716"> 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">WEBGL</span></p>
 
		<p class="p">While more and more browsers are supporting WEBGL by default, WEBGL allows accessing the
					graphics API of the computer on a very low level, which may also lead to low
					level exploits. This is the main reason why some browsers have no support for
					WebGL at all.</p>
 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is currently not using WEBGL. 
		</p>
 
	 </div><div class="sectiondiv" id="section_30E13FB57F6B404BA1469FFD6802AA3F"> 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">WebSockets</span></p>
 
		<p class="p">While WebSockets offer great new possibilities for the client/server communication of web
				applications, there have been many security issues rising while the first
				implementations were done by the browser vendors. Standardization of WebSockets has
				reached a stable state with RFC 6455 and is now implemented beginning with Chrome
				16, Firefox 11 and Internet Explorer 10. Even if the browser implementations
				themselves prove to be secure, using WebSockets may require additional security
				measures on the client. </p>
 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> is currently not using WebSockets. 
		</p>
 
	 </div><div class="sectiondiv" id="section_73E16A2754484DA1A0D39140EE760419"> 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Postmessage/Onmessage</span></p>
 
		<p class="p">This is another feature in the HTML5 area, which can lead to massive security issues when not
					used correctly. <samp class="ph codeph">postMessage</samp> allows inter-window-communication
					between windows from different domains. This opens a hole in the same origin
					policy currently implemented in the browser. As soon you subscribe to the
						<samp class="ph codeph">onMessage</samp> event, you can receive messages from any other
					browser window. The application is responsible to check the originating domain
					and to process only messages that have been sent by trusted domains. </p>
 
	 	<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses postMessage for its
					debugging and tracing functionality. </p>
