<p class="p">Security on the client and server side is not sufficient if the data transport between client and
			server can be read, intercepted, or even modified by an attacker. Per default, HTTP
			communication is stateless and unencrypted and this makes it necessary to configure it
			in a way that it uses encrypted connections and to add session handling on top using
			either cookies or URL rewriting. </p>

				required for SAP applications.</p>
 
				<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> fully supports the use of HTTPS, but there are some restrictions regarding the CDN
					version of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> when HTTPS is used. It is recommended to enable or at least to
				test SSL connections in an early stage of application development, as usually
				switching to HTTPS causes some issues. First of all, when the application is started
				using HTTPS, the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> library also has to be loaded from an HTTPS server. Second,
				Internet Explorer 8 and 9 have some additional restrictions regarding cross-origin
				requests with HTTPS, which are related to the security zone concept. </p>

		<p class="p">Even if the data transport is secured using SSL or TLS, there are possibilities to hijack such
				a secure connection and send malicious requests from the client. Cross-site request

				attacks. </p>

		  OData Model, where a XSRF token is read from the server and used for subsequent
		  write requests.
