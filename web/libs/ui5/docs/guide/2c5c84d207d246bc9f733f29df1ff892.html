	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If you want to navigate to multiple target views with the same hash, you can either
		assign multiple targets to a route, or define parents for target views.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Multiple targets for the same route</div><div type="Multiple targets for the same route">
			
			<p class="p">In the routing configuration, you can add multiple targets for the same route.</p>

			<p class="p">All target view instances are created and loaded in the order that they appear in the target option of a route when the pattern is matched.</p>

			<p class="p">If you add multiple targets to a route, this builds a connection between the targets on the route level only. The targets can still be displayed
				separately if needed. Use this approach when the connection between the targets is only needed  in some routes, but not always.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Parent relationship</div><div type="Parent relationship">
			
			<p class="p">You can also define a parent for a target in the target definition. For the parent, you also create an entry in the <samp class="ph codeph">targets</samp>
				configuration, but you don't have to create a corresponding route.</p>

			<p class="p">Whenever a target has a parent, an instance of the parent is always created before an instance of the target is created.</p>

			<p class="p">A parent relationship between targets tightly couples the two targets together. The parent target is always displayed before the child target is
				displayed. The child target can't be displayed without first displaying the parent target. This approach is mainly used when the view in the
				child target is added to an aggregation of the view in the parent target. </p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">There is also a <samp class="ph codeph">parent</samp> property for the <samp class="ph codeph">route</samp>. This property is only used when its parent exists in a parent component
					of the current component (see <a class="xref" href="2c66fb3eb775426087401117cfa6a94e.html" title="If you use nested component definitions in your app, you can connect the routing definition of these components by using a parent-relationship for routes.">Working with Nested Components</a>). For all other types of parent-child relationships,
					either use multiple targets or a parent relationship in targets.</p>

			<p class="p">In the following example, the relationship between the views <samp class="ph codeph">employeeOverviewTop</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">employeeOverviewContent</samp> is
				established by assigning both to the same route.</p>

			<p class="p">The relationship between the target <samp class="ph codeph">employeeOverview</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">employeeOverviewTop</samp>
					(<samp class="ph codeph">employeeOverviewContent</samp> respectively) is a parent relationship.</p>

When the button is pressed, a new page opens that contains two parts: a header part at the top and a content part. The content part displays a table of employees that can be sorted and searched. We will use the array notation in the routing configuration to assign multiple targets to a route - a feature that we have not yet introduced.">Step 11: Assign Multiple Targets</a>.</p>
