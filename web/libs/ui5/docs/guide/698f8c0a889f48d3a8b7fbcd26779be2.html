		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Why can't OPA find the control I'm looking for?</div><div type="Why can't OPA find the control I'm looking for?">
			
			<p class="p">OPA checks a lot of conditions before it passes a control to your
				matchers/actions/success functions. If your control does not match these conditions,
				you will never be able to set a breakpoint. For such instances, OPA logs a lot of
				information into the browser's console, if you turn on the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> debug mode. You
				can either use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-debug=true</samp> URL parameter or the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
				<a class="xref" href="6ec18e80b0ce47f290bc2645b0cc86e6.html#loio6ec18e80b0ce47f290bc2645b0cc86e6" title="The Diagnostics window available in OpenUI5 is a support tool that runs within an existing OpenUI5 app.">Diagnostics</a>. The diagnostics may also be
				helpful to see the state of your UI.</p>

			<p class="p">After turning on the debug mode, you can have a look at the log and also filter it by
				looking for <kbd class="ph userinput">opa</kbd> or <kbd class="ph userinput">matchers</kbd>.</p>

			<p class="p">A frequent cause of error are typos in the view name or control IDs. These are easily
				found by looking through the logs.</p>

				<p class="p subsectiontitle"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Is it the startup that's failing?</span></p>

				<p class="p">Maybe the app is loading too slowly for the OPA tests. If there's a local index
					file that does not contain the library dependencies your application needs, the
						<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
					bootstrap is very slow. To fix this, add the dependencies you need in your
					application descriptor's <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.dependencies</samp> namespace. If you
					do not have a descriptor, use the bootstrap option libs. For more information,
					see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a> and <a class="xref" href="91f2d03b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="The complete list of configuration options available in OpenUI5 can be found in the API Reference under sap.ui.core.Configuration. The following table shows a subset of the available configuration options.">Configuration Options and URL Parameters</a> respectively.</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">It's failing during the execution</span></p>

				<p class="p">If this happens, your test is probably executing actions faster than it should.
					If you encounter a failure, look at the current state of the UI - in almost all
					cases an action could not be triggered or a JavaScript error occurred. This
					error should be included in the console logs. If an action could not be
					executed, please make sure you use the action parameter of OPA5's
						<samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> function. When using the success function for
					triggering actions, OPA5 does not check a lot of things.</p>

				<p class="p">Here are some examples that have occurred in known applications:</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loio698f8c0a889f48d3a8b7fbcd26779be2__ul_lkh_fw1_55">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">An application was using the <samp class="ph codeph">bindingContext</samp> of a control
							in a press handler. OPA5 was way faster than a human user, so the
							HTTP-Request that was sometimes finished by the time OPA5 was executing
							the check, was sometimes still pending and so an exception was thrown.
							The test failed because OPA was trying to reach a page that could not be
							shown because of this error. This had to be fixed in the application
							coding.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">When there was no action parameter available, a <samp class="ph codeph">ListItem</samp>
							got rerendered while a press action was executed on it. Due to the
							rerendering, the <samp class="ph codeph">List</samp> was not able to perform the
							click, meaning it was not executed and the test failed. This only
							happened on certain occasions, depending on the execution speed of the
							machine executing the test. This is now detected automatically when
							using actions.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>

				<p class="p subsectiontitle"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Am i comparing language-dependent texts and the browser has a
						different language?</span></p>

				<p class="p">Check the logs to see if your matcher is failing because it's checking a text
					against a different language. If you want to always execute your tests with the
					same language, use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap-ui-language=</samp> URL or bootstrap
					parameter.</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">It is only Internet Explorer that's
					affected?</span></p>

				<p class="p">If you are using an IFrame to launch your application, Internet Explorer is more
					strict when it comes to objects from removed IFrames. If you are using the OPA
					context to remember objects, then destroy your frame and then execute a function
					on the object, you will get a JavaScript exception. How do you avoid it? By only
					remembering values like strings or integers when destroying the frame, or by
					using the component startup in OPA5.</p>

			<p class="p">If you require <span class="ph filepath">sinon-qunit.js</span>, it overwrites the browser
				functions <samp class="ph codeph">setTimeout</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">setInterval</samp>. OPA needs
				these functions and without them, the tests will not start. You can either set the
					<samp class="ph codeph">fakeTimers</samp> to false in your test setup, or maybe consider not
				using sinon together with OPA.</p>
