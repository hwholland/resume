	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use a unique ID for a fragment that will be used as a prefix for all controls in
		a fragment instance.</p>

		<p class="p">In <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, IDs are either automatically generated or given as string constants by the
			application developer.</p>

		<p class="p">In MVC views, another type of reusable components, all IDs that are given as static strings
			inside the declarative views (XML, HTML, JSON) are automatically prefixed with the view
			ID. For JS views and for controls created in the controller code of declarative views,
			no automated prefixing exists. Instead, we recommend using the
				<samp class="ph codeph">View.createId()</samp> method to prefix the ID and ensure there are no ID
			collisions even when the view is used multiple times within the same page.</p>

		<p class="p">The method <samp class="ph codeph">View.byId()</samp> is used to handle these prefixed IDs.</p>

		<p class="p">Fragments, however, are meant to be a more light-weight concept of separating and reusing UI
			parts. What's more, there are no fragment instances involved which could have IDs and
			handle ID prefixing helper functions (in contrast to view instances). For this reason,
			stable IDs in fragments are used "as is" by default, meaning they are not prefixed to
			make them unique. If no ID is given, it will be generated. However, if a fragment is
			intended to be used more than once within one application, the prefixing mechanism can
			still be used by giving an ID when instantiating the fragment.</p>

		<p class="p">The basic principle is as follows: When a control ID is defined, declarative views add a
			prefix and the code in views should add a prefix. Fragments also add a prefix if they
			have a defined ID.</p>

		<p class="p">To get rid of the prefixes, the instance method <samp class="ph codeph">View.byId()</samp> can be used
			with the static method <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Fragment.createID()</samp> if required,
			that is, if a fragment added a prefix.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">Do <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> rely on the specific prefixing syntax because it may change at
				some point. Always use methods like <samp class="ph codeph">byId()</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">createId()</samp>. </p>
