			<p class="p">The purpose of data binding in the UI is to separate the definition of the user interface (<dfn class="term">view</dfn>), the data visualized by the
				application (<dfn class="term">model</dfn>), and the code for the business logic for processing the data (<dfn class="term">controller</dfn>). The separation has the
				following advantages: It provides better readability, maintainability, and extensibility and it allows you to change the view without touching
				the underlying business logic and to define several views of the same data.</p>

			<p class="p">Views and controllers often form a 1:1 relationship, but it is also possible to have controllers without a UI, these controllers are called
				application controllers. It is also possible to create views without controllers. From a technical position, a view is a <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> control and can have or inherit a <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> model. </p>

			<p class="p">View and controller represent reusable units, and distributed development is highly supported.</p>
