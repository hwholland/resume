			<p class="p">The OData V4 model uses an <samp class="ph codeph">odata.metadata=minimal</samp> header in its requests to
				reduce the amount of data that is sent from server to client. For more information,
				see section "3.1.1 odata.metadata=minimal" in the <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.oasis-open.org%2Fodata%2Fodata-json-format%2Fv4.0%2Fos%2Fodata-json-format-v4.0-os.html" alt="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/os/odata-json-format-v4.0-os.html" title="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/os/odata-json-format-v4.0-os.html">OData JSON Format Version 4.0<img src="images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a> specification.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">$expand and $select</div><div type="$expand and $select">
			
			<p class="p">An application can either specify <samp class="ph codeph">$expand</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">$select</samp> parameters to read all data to be displayed in one
				request, or create bindings dynamically to load only part of the data with one
				request per binding. The application needs to decide whether to have less roundtrips
				with a bigger payload or more roundtrips with smaller payload. </p>

			<p class="p">To reduce payload, applications should only select properties that are needed using
					<samp class="ph codeph">$select</samp> (see the code sample in the <a class="xref" href="54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d.html#loio54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d__section_Parameters">Parameters</a> section under <a class="xref" href="54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d.html" title="Bindings connect OpenUI5 view elements to model data, allowing changes in the model to be reflected in the view element and vice versa.">Bindings</a>). Besides the properties needed
				on the UI, the binding must select key properties to support features such as read
				requests sent from a child binding, write requests, or bound operations on the
				respective entity.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Batching Requests or Not</div><div type="Batching Requests or Not">
			
			<p class="p">By default, the OData V4 model collects all requests made to the OData service in a batch
				request to reduce the number of roundtrips. The disadvantage of a batch request is
				that it cannot be cached by the browser. If some of the requests (e.g. value help
				requests) are "cacheable", it is a good idea to request these resources directly and
				use the browser cache to improve the performance of the application. In such cases,
				use the <samp class="ph codeph">$direct</samp> group as described in the section <a class="xref" href="74142a38e3d4467c8d6a70b28764048f.html" title="OData V4 allows you to group multiple operations into a single HTTP request payload, as described in the official OData V4 specification Part 1, Batch Requests (see the link under Related Information for more details).">Batch Control</a>.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Binding Caches</div><div type="Binding Caches">
			
			<p class="p">Absolute bindings and also relative bindings, which fulfill certain conditions, have a cache
				that is used for their data. Once data is read, all value requests (e.g. those made
				by dependent relative bindings) are served by this cached data.
					<samp class="ph codeph">ODataListBinding</samp> additionally supports paging. For more
				information about this, see <a class="xref" href="54e0ddf695af4a6c978472cecb01c64d.html" title="Bindings connect OpenUI5 view elements to model data, allowing changes in the model to be reflected in the view element and vice versa.">Bindings</a>. </p>

			<p class="p">Calling <samp class="ph codeph">refresh</samp> on an absolute binding clears its cache as well as the caches
				of its relative child bindings. Calling <samp class="ph codeph">refresh</samp> on the model
				refreshes all bindings that have been created by that model. </p>

			<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
				<p class="p">Relative bindings have an own cache store cache by context. When you change the context of
					the relative binding and then switch back to the previous context, the latter
					context change will not lead to a data request as the cache holding this data is
					reused. This is useful for master-detail scenarios where selection in the master
					leads to setting the corresponding context in the relative binding for the
					detail. Entries in the master that have already been selected won't lead to a
					data request.</p>

				<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Note:</span> For the above mechanism to work, you must not recreate
					a relative binding as you then lose the cache for the previously selected
					contexts. Keep the binding and just set its context.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio5a0d286c5606424b8e0d663c87445733__section_uhx_xn4_cdb"><div class="section_title">Early requests for metadata and security token</div><div type="Early requests for metadata and security token">
			
			<p class="p">The requests for the service's root <samp class="ph codeph">$metadata</samp> document and
				annotation files and for the security token may be on the "critical execution path":
				By default, these requests are sent lazily when the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> application
				starts, for example. only when the corresponding information is needed. This delays
				application startup until these requests have returned.</p>

			<p class="p">If you construct the model with parameter <span class="keyword parmname">earlyRequests</span>, the
				requests are sent as early as possible and application startup performance may
				improve.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p"> Modern browsers typically can process up to six parallel requests. Therefore it
					strongly depends on the number of requests sent initially by the application, if
					and how much the performance improves.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="note remember"><span class="remembertitle">Remember</span> 
				<p class="p">The default value for <samp class="ph codeph">earlyRequests</samp> is false in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> version
					1.54. It may, however, change to true in later releases: Do not rely on the
					default value and explicitly set it to false to ensure the requests are not sent
					early.</p>
