	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You use busy indicators to inform users that something is going on in the background,
		for example, some data is being fetched from the back end and the user has to wait. As long
		as the busy indicator is shown, either all or a specific part of the UI is blocked, and no
		user interaction is possible.</p>

		<p class="p">Whenever busy indication is triggered, the default delay until the busy indicator is displayed
			on the UI is 1000 ms (1 second). If this delay were not in place, the busy indicator
			would always be displayed, even if there is no negotiable waiting time.</p>

		<div class="p">You can choose between the following busy indicators, depending on your use case:<ul class="ul" id="loio0dd211065c714c0d8a35cecb5fea8557__ul_jcm_p42_t5">
				<li class="li">

			<div class="p">You can use the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.BusyIndicator</samp> busy indicator to block the whole
				UI. You can set the delay in ms by specifying the number:
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">sap.ui.core.BusyIndicator.show(<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">&lt;number&gt;</span>);</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">To release the UI again, the busy indication must be hidden again. This function call hides
				the busy indication
				immediately:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">sap.ui.core.BusyIndicator.hide();</pre></div>

			<p class="p">With the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.BusyDialog</samp> busy indicator, you can block the whole UI like you
				do with <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.BusyIndicator</samp>, but you can also show a dialog
				box. In this dialog box, you can also include a <span class="ph uicontrol">Cancel</span> button
				that users can choose to stop the activity that's running in the background.</p>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.BusyIndicator</samp> busy indicator blocks specific UI areas that are
				defined by a control. For example, if a table in a complex UI is loading, only the
				table is blocked - the user can still carry on working with the rest of the UI.</p>

			<p class="p"> If a control is set to busy, the complete control will be covered with a block layer, so no
				mouse events or keyboard interaction with the control are possible. If keyboard
				navigation is being used to step through the controls, controls that are set to
					<samp class="ph codeph">busy</samp> are skipped and the focus jumps to the next control.</p>

			<div class="p">Here's how to do it:
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">	var oInput = new sap.m.Input({
		value:'Hello World'
	});
...
	<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">oInput.setBusy(true);</span>
</pre></div>
The
				following code shows how you define the default state of a control as
					<samp class="ph codeph">busy</samp> so that it will be displayed as busy when it has been
				rendered:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">	var oInput = new sap.m.Input({
		value:'Hello World',
		<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">busy: true
</span>
	});
</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">To release the control's busy state again, the same API can be used. This has to be done by
				the application after some data has been loaded, for example with the following
				command:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">oMyListBox.setBusy(false);</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">To change the default delay of the local busy indicator,
				use:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">oMyListBox.setBusyIndicatorDelay(<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">&lt;number&gt;</span>);</pre></div>
</div>
