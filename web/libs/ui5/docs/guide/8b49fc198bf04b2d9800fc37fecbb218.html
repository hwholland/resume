			<div class="p">You might have to adapt parts of the coding to your local development environment to
				make the app work. Please check the following settings carefully:<ul class="ul" id="loio8b49fc198bf04b2d9800fc37fecbb218__ul_gnb_qyf_rs">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Project Path and Deployment</span></p>

						<p class="p">All tutorials assume that the app is deployed and can be accessed under a certain path on a
							web server. You will not be able to run the app without a Web server as
							the browser does not allow you to load the required resources locally
							due to security restrictions.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
								Resources</span></p>

						<p class="p">You can either download and deploy the runtime to your (local) Web server or reference the
							CDN version located at <span class="ph filepath">https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js</span>.
							Some development environments such as the <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>
							also provide a local runtime for testing purposes. If you download the
							code from the samples in the Demo Kit, you will have to adapt the
								<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">resource path in the bootstrap section</span> of all
							HTML pages included in the project. In the tutorial code, we assume that
								<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
							can be accessed from the <samp class="ph codeph">/resources</samp> path of the
							server.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Accessing Remote Services</span></p>

						<p class="p">Browsers typically prevent accessing remote resources due to the
							Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. If you would like to call a
							real service or remote resources, you will have to either configure the
							development environment or the remote server to accept these requests.
							This strongly depends on the development environment and is described in
							more detail below.</p>
