		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Dos and Don'ts</div><div type="Dos and Don'ts">
			
			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">When writing QUnits, always keep your tests atomic.</li>

				<li class="li">Don't rely on the execution of previous tests.</li>

				<li class="li">Don't introduce globals, destroy controls after creating them.</li>

				<li class="li">Only test one single thing.</li>

				<li class="li">When writing a test, always make sure you break it first: don't rely on tests that have
					never failed!</li>

				<li class="li">Write human readable tests - use descriptive names for variables. Readability is more
					important than performance. You don't have to write a reuse for everything. It's
					ok to repeat yourself in unit tests if it helps readability.</li>

				<li class="li">Don't test too many internal aspects: try to test the control like an application or user
					will use it.</li>

				<li class="li">You have to find a balance between not stubbing / expecting too much of the internal aspects
					and not doing it at all. If you tightly couple your test to the implementation,
					maintenance will be a pain.</li>

				<li class="li">If your test is too long, you're squeezing too much stuff into one of your control's
					functions. Divide the complexity, then your test will be simpler and your
					productive code will be better.</li>

				<li class="li">Don't test general <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
					functionality. Only test things actually done by your control (see "What Should
					You Test?" below).</li>

				<li class="li">Never write an <samp class="ph codeph">if</samp> in a test. It is a sign that you're either not stubbing
					correctly or you're testing multiple things in one test.</li>

				<li class="li">Never use the <samp class="ph codeph">expect</samp> QUnit statement. You should always write your test in
					a way that every assertion you set up will be hit 100%.</li>

				<li class="li">Whenever you encounter a Bug/Ticket, start by writing a QUnit that fails first, and
						<em class="ph i">then</em> fix the code.</li>

				<li class="li">Write your tests as small as possible: don't add a statement that is not needed for the
					test, such as an ID in the control's constructor properties.</li>

				<li class="li">Use fake timers to avoid as many async tests as possible.</li>

				<li class="li">Don't test the exact same thing multiple times.</li>

				<li class="li">Use modules for grouping your tests: this will give you a better organizational test
					setup.</li>

				<li class="li">You may use modules for <samp class="ph codeph">beforeEach/afterEach</samp>, but don't overuse this
					feature. If you have a longer module, you might not see what the test does
					because you don't know its setup.</li>

				<li class="li">It's sometimes better to write code multiple times.</li>

				<li class="li">Don't set up your system being tested in the <samp class="ph codeph">beforeEach/afterEach</samp>. It is
					very rare that all tests in a module have the same constructor. Furthermore,
					using a global constructor object is dangerous.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">If you stick to these rules, you will find it much easier to refactor/maintain your tests.
				Keeping the tests atomic will make debugging much easier, because you will hit your
				breakpoints for the code being tested only. If you write QUnits without keeping to
				these rules, you may well not notice anything bad to begin with, but you <strong class="ph b">will</strong>
				eventually end up in the middle of a maintenance nightmare!</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Arrange Act Assert Pattern</div><div type="Arrange Act Assert Pattern"><p class="p">Internally, we use three templates for
				testing. The one shown below is the general control template. If you are using
				Eclipse, a description of how you can import the templates is included at the end of
				this section.</p>
<p class="p">Use the following pattern to structure your tests. If everyone
				sticks to this same pattern, you will be able to read your colleagues' tests very
				quickly:</p>
<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
QUnit.test("Should do Something", function (assert) { 
    // Arrange
    
    // System under Test

    });

    // Assert

    // Cleanup
    oMyControl.destroy();
});</pre></div>
<div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Arrange</p>

				<p class="p">In <samp class="ph codeph">Arrange</samp>, you should set up the dependencies and options you
					need for your <samp class="ph codeph">System under Test</samp>.</p>

				<p class="p subsectiontitle">System under test</p>

				<p class="p">This part may contain multiple statements of QUnit assertions, but ideally not

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Optional: Cleanup</p>

				<li class="li">Test RTL if you have special things done in javascript.</li>

			<p class="p">In the rendering tests part, you have to place your control in the DOM. The best place to put
				it is the <samp class="ph codeph">qunit-fixture</samp> div, since its content gets deleted after
				every test.</p>

			<p class="p">Make sure you destroy your control, since <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> will keep a reference to it and may also
				rerender it.</p>

			<p class="p">It's crucial that you call <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.getCore().applyChanges()</samp> after each time
				you have caused a rerendering.</p>

			<p class="p">The call to this function synchronizes the changes of your control with the DOM. If you do not
				make this call, the DOM will not be updated.</p>

			<p class="p">You can use the following template to make sure that you don't forget to destroy your
				control:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">QUnit.test("Should do Something", function(assert) {
    // Arrange
        var oContructor = {
        
    };
    
    // System under Test
    var oMyControl = new nameSpace.myControl(oContructor);
    oMyControl.placeAt("qunit-fixture");
    sap.ui.getCore().applyChanges();

    // Act
    
    // Assert

    // Cleanup
    oMyControl.destroy();
});</pre></div>

				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Sinon fake timers</p>

				<p class="p">If you are using <samp class="ph codeph">sinon.qunit</samp>, it will automatically use fake timers by
					itself. Fake timers will prevent any <samp class="ph codeph">setTimeout/setIntervall</samp>
					function from being executed, unless you call
						<samp class="ph codeph">this.clock.tick(milliseconds)</samp> in your test. This means that
					a Mock Server with auto-respond will not respond and OPA will not be able to
					wait for controls.</p>

				<p class="p">In addition, control events might be fired inside of a <samp class="ph codeph">setTimeout(, 0)</samp>, so
					the event might not be triggered at all.</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Testing <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> control events with Sinon</p>

				<p class="p">If you want to test <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> events, you can use spies to test how often they are
					called. If you try to test the parameters, however, you cannot do this with spies as <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> uses an eventPool that reuses the same object again. This means that
					after an event is set, all of the parameters will be deleted, Sinon will keep a reference to the object without properties.</p>

				<p class="p">The effect of this is that you cannot assert on them anymore. The workaround is to use a stub with a custom implementation that saves a copy
					of the parameters to your test function scope.</p>

				<p class="p">An example of this is shown in the cookbook below (events).</p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">I've set a property on my control: Why aren't the changes in the
					DOM?</p>

				<p class="p">The most likely reason for this is that <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.getCore().applyChanges()</samp> was not called. <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> does not render synchronously, but calling this function will render
					immediately.</p>
