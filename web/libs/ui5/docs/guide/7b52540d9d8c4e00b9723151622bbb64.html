	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Defining the Control Metadata</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Control metadata consists of properties, events, as well as aggregations and
		associations.</p>

		<p class="p">The control metadata is defined as follows:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio7b52540d9d8c4e00b9723151622bbb64__ul_gqc_fgp_zm">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Properties</p>

				<p class="p">A property has a name and an associated data type. It has a well-defined default value
					expressed as a literal of that data type. Properties are accessible to
					application code via the element's API as getters and setters, but are also used
					by a control's renderer in a read-only way. The following list gives an overview
					of the available settings:</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loio7b52540d9d8c4e00b9723151622bbb64__ul_iwr_ngp_zm">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">type</samp>: Data type of the control property; <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> provides an automatic type
							validation. Valid types are, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">string</samp>
							(default) for a string property, <samp class="ph codeph">int</samp> or
								<samp class="ph codeph">float</samp> for number properties,
							<samp class="ph codeph">int[]</samp>, etc. for arrays and
								<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.CSSSize</samp> for a custom-defined type.</p>

						<p class="p">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="ac56d92162ed47ff858fdf1ce26c18c4.html">Defining Control Properties</a>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">defaultValue</samp>: Default value that is set if the application does not set a
							value; if no default value is defined, the property value is
								<samp class="ph codeph">undefined</samp>.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>

				<p class="p">These control-specific settings are only available when inheriting from a control or one of
					the base classes <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Control</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Element</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.base.ManagedObject</samp>, see <a class="xref" href="91f29fea6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html" title="OpenUI5 supports the extension of plain objects that are not elements or controls.">Object Metadata and Implementation</a>.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Events</p>

				<p class="p">An event has a name as well as any number of parameters. The element's API offers
					support to manage event subscriptions.</p>

				<p class="p">It is defined by its name only.</p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">events: {
   "logout": {}
}</pre></div>

				<p class="p">For each event, methods for registering, de-registering and firing the event are created. For
					the <samp class="ph codeph">logout</samp> event, for example, the
						<samp class="ph codeph">attachLogout</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">detachLogout</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">fireLogout</samp> methods are created.</p>

				<p class="p">A control can enable events to be interrupted by the application. A tab control, for example,
					can enable the application to cancel a <samp class="ph codeph">close</samp> event by setting
					the <samp class="ph codeph">allowPreventDefault</samp> property of the event to
						<samp class="ph codeph">true</samp> and checking the return value after firing the
					event:</p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">events: {
   "close": {allowPreventDefault : true}  
}</pre></div>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Aggregations and Associations</p>

				<p class="p">An <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">aggregation</span> is a special relation between two UI element
					types. It is used to define the parent-child relationship within the above
					mentioned tree structure. The parent end of the aggregation has cardinality
						<samp class="ph codeph">0..1</samp>, while the child end may have <samp class="ph codeph">0..1</samp> or
						<samp class="ph codeph">0..*</samp>. The element's API offers convenient and consistent
					methods to deal with aggregations (e.g. to get, set, or remove target elements).
					Examples are table rows and cells, or the content of a table cell.</p>

				<p class="p">An <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">association</span> is another type of relation between two UI
					element types which is independent of the parent-child relationship within the
					above mentioned tree structure. Directed outgoing associations to a target of
					cardinality <samp class="ph codeph">0..1</samp> are supported. They represent a loose coupling
					only and are thus implemented by storing the target element instance's ID. The
					most prominent example is the association between a label and its field.</p>

				<p class="p">Aggregations and associations are defined by their name and a configuration
					object with the following information:</p>

				<ul class="ul" id="loio7b52540d9d8c4e00b9723151622bbb64__ul_t3g_z54_zm">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">
							<samp class="ph codeph">type</samp>: The type should be a subclass of the element or
							the control; the default is <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.control</samp></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">
							<samp class="ph codeph">multiple</samp>: Defines whether it is a 0..1 aggregation or a
							0..n aggregation; the default for aggregations is <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp>
							= 0..n, and for associations the default is <samp class="ph codeph">false</samp></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">
							<samp class="ph codeph">singularName</samp>: For 0..n aggregations, the aggregation
							name typically is plural, but certain methods are created where the
							singular form is required (for example, <samp class="ph codeph">addWorksetItem</samp>}
							for the "worksetItems" aggregation). </p>

					</li>

				</ul>

				<p class="p">If only the type needs to be set, you can just give it as a string instead of the
					configuration object. </p>

				<p class="p">One example: </p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">aggregations: {
   "acceptButton" : "sap.m.Button", // if only type is given, no object is required
   "content" : {singularName: "content"},    // default type is "sap.ui.core.Control", 
                                             // which is appropriate for generic containers
   "toolbarItems" : {type : "sap.m.Button", multiple : true, singularName : "toolbarItem"}
                                             // a fully specified aggregation
}</pre></div>

				<p class="p">Multiple methods are created automatically at runtime, depending on the multiplicity, for
					example <samp class="ph codeph">getWorksetItems</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">insertWorksetItem</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">addWorksetItem</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">removeWorksetItem</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">removeAllWorksetItems</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">indexOfWorksetItem</samp>,
						<samp class="ph codeph">destroyWorksetItems</samp>. These methods have a default
					implementation which does everything to handle the aggregation properly, but
					they can be overridden and extended by the control implementation.</p>

				<p class="p">If you want to mark one aggregation as default aggregation in order to be able to omit the
					aggregation tag in XML views, you can do this by setting the
						<samp class="ph codeph">defaultAggregation</samp> property to the name of the aggregation
					as shown in the following code snippet:</p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">aggregations: {
   "content": {singularName: "content"} // default type is "sap.ui.core.Control", multiple is "true"

},
defaultAggregation: "content"</pre></div>

			</li>

		</ul>
