		Design Guidelines.</p>

		<div class="p">Calling the app will result in the following:<ul class="ul" id="loio5cb1169c748b4da58a9c981fb0b491c7__ul_vxk_wc1_bt">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Only initially a global busy indicator is displayed that overlays the whole
						app until the metadata of the service is loaded.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">A local busy indicator is displayed on the worklist table or on the page of
						the object view while the data from the service is loading.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">When controls are loading additional data or getting refreshed, a local busy
						indication is displayed automatically.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
</div>

		<p class="p">By default, the busy indicator delay is set to one second for all controls. This would first
			show the UI for a second, then show a busy indication until the data is loaded. To avoid
			this behavior initially and show the busy indicator immediately without delay the
			following concept is implemented in the app: The <samp class="ph codeph">busyIndicatorDelay</samp> and
				<samp class="ph codeph">busy</samp> properties of certain controls (<samp class="ph codeph">AppView</samp>,
				<samp class="ph codeph">Table</samp> on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Worklist</span> page,
				<samp class="ph codeph">FullScreenPage</samp> on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Object</span> page) are bound
			to the local view model and manipulated in the controllers of the app. The delay is
			initially set to "0" for displaying the busy indicator immediately, and reset to the
			previous value after the initial loading is done.</p>
