		for a basic test coverage of the initial app. The tests are written independently of the

		<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">webapp</span> folder of the template app contains a
				<span class="ph filepath">test.html</span> file which serves as an overview for the different
			test pages. You can run the app with or without mock data and run the unit and
			integration tests. This section describes which application tests are provided and how
			they are structured.</p>

			<div class="p">The integration tests shipped with the template cover all basic functionality and
				provide several "journeys". Journeys include a series of OPA tests that belong to
				the same functionality and should be executed together:<ul class="ul" id="loio7bd4e6ebb9744c50b62ed048c93a2d9d__ul_awt_jq1_bt">
					<li class="li">

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">NotFoundJourney</samp>: Several "not found" cases of the
