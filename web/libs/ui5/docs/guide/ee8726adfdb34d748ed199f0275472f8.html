				browser.</p>

			<div class="p">This build-free development process does not deliver optimized runtime performance
				(for example, there are many small requests, which would not be acceptable for
				remote connections). There are mainly two mechanisms applied that adapt the
					sources:<ul class="ul" id="loioee8726adfdb34d748ed199f0275472f8__ul_td1_mqq_gs">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">The Git repository path contains a folder with the same name as the respective control
							library (for example, <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp>), which is omitted at
							runtime. The Node.js-based server is configured to map the
							locations.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">The CSS files are transformed (server-side) by the LESS preprocessor during the first
							request after a CSS file has been modified. This includes mirroring for
							right-to-left support. After a CSS modification, this first request to
							the respective <span class="ph filepath">library.css</span> file will take several
							hundred milliseconds, depending on the amount of CSS involved. This is
							the LESS processing time.</p>
