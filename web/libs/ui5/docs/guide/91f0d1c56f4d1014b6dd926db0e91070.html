	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If you don't want to use a component or descriptor file, you have to assign the model
		instance manually to the UI, before you can bind controls to this model
		instance.</p>

		<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> provides a flexible
			and modularized concept in which you can not only define one model for your
			applications, but define different areas in your application with different models and
			assign single controls to a model. You can, for example, define a JSON model for the
			application and an OData model for a table contol that is contained in the application.
			You can also set multiple models for a control, a UI area, or the core by specifying a
			name for the model. These models can be accessed by their name. </p>

		<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">var oJSONModel = new sap.ui.model.json.JSONModel();
var oODataModel  = new sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel("myServicelUrl");
var oControl  = new sap.m.Input();

oControl.setModel(oODataModel);
//set the JSONModel with the name 'myJSONModel' to the same control
oControl.setModel(oJSONModel,"myJSONModel");</pre></div>

		<p class="p">When you set a model to a UI area or control, it will be propagated to all aggregated
			child controls. So if you set a model to a container control, for example, all controls
			that are contained (aggregated) in this container have access to this model. If one of
			the contained controls has its own model set (with the same name), the propagation
			stops. It is not possible to have two models with the same name set to one control
			instance.</p>



		<p class="p">Choose one of the following options:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio91f0d1c56f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070__choices_bnc_3vt_5k">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">You can define a global model that can be accessed by all controls from all UI
					areas by using the <samp class="ph codeph">setModel</samp> method on the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> core object.
					This is useful for simple form applications or demo applications. </p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
sap.ui.getCore().setModel(oModel);</pre></div>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">You can also define a specific model for sections within a UI area, for example,
					inside a panel or for a table control. In this case, you can use the
						<samp class="ph codeph">setModel</samp> method available on any control: </p>

				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">
var oTable = sap.ui.getCore().byId("table");
oTable.setModel(oModel);</pre></div>
