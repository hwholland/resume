				thrown for any route that matches to our route configuration in the descriptor file. In the event handler, we determine the name of the matched
				route from the event parameters and log it together with a time stamp. In an actual app, the information could be sent to a back-end system or
				an analytics server to find out more about the usage of your app.</p>

			<p class="p">Now you can access, for example, <samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html#/employees</samp> while

				for each navigation step that you do within the app.</p>
