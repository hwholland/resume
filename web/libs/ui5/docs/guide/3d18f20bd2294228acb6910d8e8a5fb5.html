        <div class="figcap">Routing overview</div></div></div>

        <p class="p">In <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>, navigation and routing is implemented using a “router” to forward the hash
            change and the data in the hash to one or more views of the app. </p>

        <p class="p">You use <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">routes</span> to notify your application that the hash has changed to a certain value. For each route, you define the pattern
            that can be used in the app implementation.</p>

        <p class="p">With <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">targets</span>, you define where a view is loaded and where the view is shown on the UI. By referring to one or multiple targets
            in a route's definition, you can load and show the views once the route's pattern matches the current hash.</p>

        <p class="p">You configure routing in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> in the descriptor file
                (<span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span>) (see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>) or in the <span class="ph filepath">Component.js</span>
            file (see <a class="xref" href="958ead51e2e94ab8bcdc90fb7e9d53d0.html" title="Components are independent and reusable parts used in OpenUI5 applications.">Components</a> ) to have it available globally throughout your app, but you can also define routes
            and targets locally by calling the constructors of the classes, for example under the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.routing</samp> and
                <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.routing</samp> namespaces.</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
            <p class="p">You can also define only routes or only targets, but then just have to make sure that you implement the counterpart elsewhere.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><div class="section_title">Routing Patterns</div><div type="Routing Patterns">
            
            <p class="p">Whenever a hash is added to a URL, the router checks whether there is a route with a matching pattern. The first matching route is taken and the
                corresponding target view is called. The data provided with the hash are passed on to the target.</p>

            <div class="p">You can use the following kinds of patterns:<ul class="ul" id="loio3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5__ul_icm_4qf_1w">
                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Hard-coded pattern</span>:</p>

                        <p class="p">The pattern matches the hash exactly. For example, when a pattern is defined as <samp class="ph codeph">product/settings</samp>, this pattern
                            matches only if the hash is <kbd class="ph userinput">product/settings</kbd> and  no data is passed on to the events of the route.</p>

                        <p class="p">For more information, see the tutorial <a class="xref" href="782aac08f2de4003a2fcbdd39d27f374.html" title="In this step, we'll create a second button on the home page, with which we can navigate to a simple list of employees. This example illustrates how to navigate to a route that has a hard-coded pattern.">Step 6: Navigate to Routes with Hard-Coded Patterns</a>.</p>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Route with mandatory parameter</span>:</p>

                        <p class="p">You can define mandatory parameters for the pattern by placing the parameter in curly brackets (<samp class="ph codeph">{<em class="ph i">parameter ID</em>}</samp>). </p>

                        <p class="p">For example, if you define the pattern <samp class="ph codeph">product/{id}</samp>, the hashes <kbd class="ph userinput">product/5</kbd> and
                                <kbd class="ph userinput">product/3</kbd> (where 3 and 5 are product IDs) match the pattern. The matched event handler gets
                                <samp class="ph codeph">5</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">3</samp> passed on with the key <samp class="ph codeph">id</samp> in its arguments. But hash
                                <kbd class="ph userinput">product/</kbd> does not match the pattern because the mandatory parameter is missing.</p>

                        <p class="p">For more information, see the tutorial <a class="xref" href="f96d2522a5ca4382a274ae3c6d002ca0.html" title="In this step, we implement a feature that allows the user to click on an employee in the list to see additional details of the employee. A route pattern can have one or more mandatory parameters to identify objects in an app.">Step 7: Navigate to Routes with Mandatory Parameters</a>.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Route with optional parameter</span>:</p>

                        <p class="p">You can define optional parameters for the pattern by placing the parameter between colons (<samp class="ph codeph">:<em class="ph i">parameter ID</em>:</samp>). </p>

                        <p class="p">For example, if you define a pattern <samp class="ph codeph">product/{id}/detail/:detailId:</samp>, the <samp class="ph codeph">detailId</samp> parameter is
                            optional, whereas <samp class="ph codeph">id</samp> is mandatory. Both hashes <samp class="ph codeph">product/5/detail</samp> and
                                <samp class="ph codeph">product/3/detail/2</samp> match the pattern.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Route with query parameter</span>:</p>

                        <p class="p">The query parameter allows you to pass on queries with any parameter. A query parameter starts with <samp class="ph codeph">?</samp>, and you can
                            either define it as mandatory (<samp class="ph codeph">product{?query}</samp>) or optional (<samp class="ph codeph">product:?query:</samp>).</p>

                        <p class="p">The matched value will be converted into an object saved with the parameter name as the key when passed to the event handler.</p>

                        <p class="p">For more information, see the tutorial <a class="xref" href="b8561ff6f4c34c85a91ed06d20814cd3.html" title="The resume view contains four tabs as we have seen in the previous steps. However, when the user navigates to the resume page, only the first tab is displayed initially. Navigating directly to a specific tab or bookmarking a tab is not yet supported in our current app.">Step 9: Allow Bookmarkable Tabs with Optional Query Parameters</a>.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li class="li">
                        <p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">"rest as string" parameter</span>:</p>

                        <p class="p">A parameter that ends with an asterisk (<samp class="ph codeph">*</samp>) is called a "rest as string" parameter. Such a parameter matches as much
                            as possible. It can be combined with the syntax of mandatory or optional parameters.</p>

                        <p class="p">For example, a pattern <samp class="ph codeph">product/{id}/:detail*:</samp> defines a mandatory parameter with the name <samp class="ph codeph">id</samp> and an
                            optional "rest as string" parameter with the name <samp class="ph codeph">detail</samp>. It matches <samp class="ph codeph">product/5/3</samp> and
                                <samp class="ph codeph">product/5/detail/3/foo</samp>. The event handler gets <samp class="ph codeph">3</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">detail/3/foo</samp> passed on
                            with the key <samp class="ph codeph">detail</samp> in its arguments.</p>
