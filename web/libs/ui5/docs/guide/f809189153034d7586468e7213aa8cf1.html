	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Master List Filtering</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use the following best practices when implementing search, sorting, filtering
		and grouping functions for a master list in your Master-Detail apps.</p>

		<p class="p">A search field is displayed in the master list to filter the list items for a custom keyword.
			In the footer of the master list, options for sorting, filtering, and grouping are
			displayed. When searching or using one of the options in the footer, the list content is
			updated automatically and the search result is displayed.</p>

		<p class="p">All four options adjust the master list content (search, sort, filter, group) and are managed
			and applied in the logic of the master controller. This section describes the
			implementation details for these four options.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Search</div><div type="Search">
			
			<p class="p">The search is implemented in a manual mode and the list operation mode is "server".
				This means that the search has to be triggered explicitly by pressing enter or the
				search button, and the results are always fetched from the server.</p>

			<p class="p">The search function is implemented using the standard <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
				<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.Filter</samp> objects. The options are added to an internal
				state object of the controller and applied together with the filters that can be
				selected in the filter options. The type of these filters is "Application", and
				these filters are added on top of the predefined filters from the framework of type
				"Control".</p>

			<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Search</span> field also displays a <span class="ph uicontrol">Refresh</span> button.
				Pressing this button triggers a simple refresh for the list binding. On
				touch-enabled devices, a refresh can be triggered by pulling the master list down
				using a <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.PullToRefresh</samp> control.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Sorting, Filtering and Grouping</div><div type="Sorting, Filtering and Grouping">
			
			<p class="p">Sorting, filtering, and grouping can be implemented in two ways:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiof809189153034d7586468e7213aa8cf1__ol_bs1_pb3_bt">
				<li class="li"> By using a semantic select control
						(<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.semantic.SortSelect</samp>/<samp class="ph codeph">GroupSelect</samp>/<samp class="ph codeph">FilterSelect</samp>
					) in the footer area of the master page (recommended for simple operations)</li>

				<li class="li"> By using a semantic button that opens a <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog</samp>
					containing options for sorting, grouping, and filtering (recommended for more
					complex logic, such as custom filters)</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">In a Master-Detail app, these two modes can also be mixed as specified in the SAP Fiori Design
				Guidelines (see <cite class="cite">Related Information</cite> at the bottom of this chapter for
				more details). In the Master-Detail template app, the sorting and grouping options
				are implemented with a semantic <samp class="ph codeph">Select</samp> control and the filtering
				options in a <samp class="ph codeph">ViewSettingsDialog</samp> control to show both use cases.</p>

			<p class="p">The event handlers that are called when selecting a sorting and grouping option are similar,
				and create a <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.Sorter</samp> object on the "key" field of the
				selected item. For the grouping functionality, a custom grouper is loaded and
				applied to the selected entry. Both sorting and grouping options are applied
				together on the binding of the master list.</p>

			<p class="p">The filtering options are implemented as an XML fragment with a
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog</samp> in a fragment. Therefore we process
				the selected filter options in the handler of the dialog's <samp class="ph codeph">confirm</samp>
				event. A <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.Filter</samp> object is created for each filter
				option that has been selected in the dialog and applied together with the search
				option on the master list.</p>

			<p class="p">The filter bar is automatically updated with the chosen filter texts. It is displayed on top
				of the master list and can be clicked to reopen the filter settings.</p>
