	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> comes with a powerful routing API that helps you control the state of your
		application efficiently. This tutorial will illustrate all major features and APIs related to navigation and routing in <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> apps by creating a simple and easy to understand mobile app. It represents a set of
		best practices for applying the navigation and routing features of <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> to your
		applications.</p>

		<p class="p">In classical Web applications, the server determines which resource is requested based on the URL pattern of the request and serves it accordingly. The
			server-side logic controls how the requested resource or page is displayed in an appropriate way.</p>

		<p class="p">In single-page applications, only one page is initially requested from the server and
			additional resources are dynamically loaded using client-side logic. The user only
			navigates within this page. The navigation is persisted in the hash instead of the
			server path or URL parameters.</p>

		<p class="p"> For example, a classical Web application might display the employee’s resume page when URL
				<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/employees/resume.html?id=3</samp>
			or
				<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/employees/3/resume</samp>
			is called. A single-page application instead would do the same thing by using a
			hash-based URL like
				<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;your-host&gt;/&lt;some-path-to-the-app&gt;/#/employees/3/resume</samp>. </p>

		<p class="p">The information in the hash, namely everything that is following the <samp class="ph codeph">#</samp> character, is interpreted by the router. </p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">This tutorial does not handle cross-app navigation with the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span>. However, the concepts described in this tutorial are also fundamental for
				navigation and routing between apps in the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span>.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="p">We will create a simple app displaying the data of a company’s employees to show typical
			navigation patterns and routing features. The complete flow of the application can be
			seen in the figure below. We'll start with the home page which lets users do the
				following:<ul class="ul" id="loio1b6dcd39a6a74f528b27ddb22f15af0d__ul_z4g_yx4_ls">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Display a <span class="ph uicontrol">Not Found</span> page</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Navigate to a list of employees and drill further down to see a
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Details</span> page for each employee</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Show an <span class="ph uicontrol">Employee Overview</span> that they can search and
						sort</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

		<div class="figcap">Page flow of the final app</div></div></div>

		<p class="p">Throughout this tutorial we will add features for navigating to pages and bookmarking them. We
			will add backward and forward navigation with common transition animations (slide, show,
			flip, etc.). We will add more pages to the app and navigate between them to show typical
			use cases. We will even learn how to implement features for bookmarking a specific
			search, table sorting via filters, and dialogs.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
			<p class="p">This tutorial is based on <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
				version 1.30 or higher. The navigation features shown in this tutorial are available
				since version 1.28. However, the configuration via the descriptor  file
					<samp class="ph codeph">manifest.json</samp> is only available since 1.30.</p>

			<p class="p">You don't have to do all tutorial steps sequentially, you can also jump directly to any step
				you want. Just download the code from the previous step, and start there.</p>

			<p class="p">You can view and download the files for all steps in the Demo Kit <span class="ph">at <a class="xref" target="_blank" href="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.navigation/samples" alt="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.navigation/samples" title="../../explored.html#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.navigation/samples">Navigation and Routing</a></span>. Copy the code to your workspace and make sure that
				the application runs by calling the <samp class="ph codeph">webapp/index.html</samp> file.
				Depending on your development environment you might have to adjust resource paths
				and configuration entries.</p>

You might also know this as a “404” or Not Found Page from traditional web pages. In this step, we will implement a feature that detects invalid hashes and visualizes this in a nice way.">Step 3: Catch Invalid Hashes</a></strong><br/>

Therefore, we will add a Back button to the Not Found view and make sure that the user gets redirected to either the previous page or the overview page when the Back button is pressed.">Step 4: Add a Back Button to Not Found Page</a></strong><br/>

We will create a simple link on the Employee view that triggers a flip navigation to a page that displays the resume data of a certain employee.

When the button is pressed, a new page opens that contains two parts: a header part at the top and a content part. The content part displays a table of employees that can be sorted and searched.
