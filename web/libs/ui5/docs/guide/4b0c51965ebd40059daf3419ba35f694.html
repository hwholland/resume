</pre></div>
</div>

			</div><p class="p">When you load the HTML file in your browser, the Gherkin tests are executed automatically . If you are using Google Chrome, you may
				need to start it with the command line flags<samp class="ph codeph"> --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security</samp>. When everything is working
				correctly, you should see something like the following in your browser:</p>
<div class="fig fignone" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__fig_ekf_jc4_kx"><div class="figcontainer">
				<img class="image" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__image_gyy_tc4_kx" src="loiobb0e61f8e0004349bdfb37f0a4f39618_LowRes.png"/>
			</div></div>
<p class="p">We expect the test to fail because we haven't written any tests yet. You'll notice that Gherkin has explained that  it was not able to find
				a matching step definition for the first test step, "I have started the app", in the steps file. Scrolling down, you can see that none of the
				test steps have been found. We will need to write these step definitions.</p>
<p class="p">Looking back at the feature file that we wrote, "I have started
				the app" is the first test step in the test scenario. Hence, it makes sense that we would see this test step first in the test results. You can
				also see the exact wording of the <samp class="ph codeph">Feature</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">Scenario</samp> text that you entered: <samp class="ph codeph">Feature: Clicking
					Buttons Is a Life Saving Activity: Scenario: Click a button, save a life!</samp>. This should make it easier for you to find your way
				around in the test results. </p>
</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible expanded"><div class="section_title">Write the first failing test</div><div type="Write the first failing test">
			
			<p class="p">To verify the feature file, we will implement a steps file, which to recap is both the translation that allows the computer to understand the
				human-readable feature file, and also the verification steps (tests) to be run. Once you have a working feature file and can execute the test
				suite, then you are ready to write your first test. We will start by writing a simple test that we expect to fail.</p>

			<div class="p">In the <span class="ph filepath">Steps</span> file, inside the <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method, add the following
				code:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">this.register(/^I have started the app$/i, function() {
  Opa5.assert.ok(false, 'This test will fail!');
});
</pre></div>
The
					<samp class="ph codeph">register</samp> method defines a new step definition and takes two arguments:<ul class="ul" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__ul_nqd_vd4_kx">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">a regular expression to match against the test steps in the feature file</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">a function to execute when there is a match </p>

					</li>

				</ul>
At test execution time, the Gherkin test harness tries to find a step definition with a matching regular expression, and execute the step
				definition's test function.</div>

			<p class="p">Try executing the test now. You should see something like this:</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__fig_n4v_f24_kx"><div class="figcontainer">
				<img class="image" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__image_ekp_g24_kx" src="loiocad81d3d87ab4c4688313ecdd70ee824_LowRes.png"/>
			</div></div>

			<p class="p">Step 1 is green because a matching step definition was found in the steps file. In Gherkin, the test harness always checks for the existence of
				the step definition first before executing the step definition's function. After Gherkin finds a step definition, it executes the step
				definition's function, and thus executes any QUnit assertions inside the function.</p>

			<p class="p">In step 2, notice how the text "This test will fail!" is copied from the steps file. You can use this functionality to make it easier to debug
				your test. We recommend that you start any QUnit assertion comment with the word <span class="q">“Verified”</span> to make it easier to read your test executions.
			</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section collapsible expanded"><div class="section_title">Write the second failing test</div><div type="Write the second failing test">
			
			<div class="p">Let's write a bit more test code. To make a test useful, it will need to load your app and verify its properties. We will use OPA5 for this
				purpose. Replace the code inside your steps file's <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp> method with the following
				code:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-js">var oOpa5 = new Opa5();

this.register(/^I have started the app$/i, function() {
  oOpa5.iStartMyAppInAFrame("Website.html");
});

this.register(/^I can see the life saving button$/i, function() {
  oOpa5.waitFor({
    id: "life-saving-button",
    success: function(oButton) {
      Opa5.assert.strictEqual(oButton.getText(), "Save a Lemming",
      "Verified that we can see the life saving button");
    }
  });
});</pre></div>
</div>

			<p class="p">You may need to adapt the above code to fit your situation. When you execute this code, you should see something like this:</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__fig_ijk_524_kx"><div class="figcontainer">
				<img class="image" id="loio4b0c51965ebd40059daf3419ba35f694__image_nvd_1f4_kx" src="loio99af4d460e284411b91e89a17ae28815_LowRes.png"/>
			</div></div>

			<p class="p">There are several important things to note here:</p>

			<p class="p">For one, now that you are actually testing the app, you will see a popup overlay of the application under test appear in the bottom right corner
				of the window. This overlay is interactive, although you should wait until the test is complete before trying to interact with it. The overlay
				is extremely helpful for debugging your tests since at any given point in time you can see what state the app is in, particularly when the
				debugger is running and execution is paused. If the overlay is getting in the way, then after the tests have finished executing you can get rid
				of it by clicking on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Close Frame</span> button at the top right.</p>

			<p class="p">In the above screenshot, steps 1 and 2 are passing because Gherkin was able to match the feature file test step to a step definition in the steps
				file. The test step "I have started the app" does not actually execute any verifications (that is, it does not call any QUnit assertion
				functions) and hence there is no verification occurring between "I have started the app" and "I can see the life saving button". Step 3 is the
				actual verification of the app executed inside the step definition "I can see the life saving button" function, and since in this example the
				app is an empty Web page, the test is failing. The error message <samp class="ph codeph">Failed to wait for check</samp> is an OPA5 error that happens when
				the <samp class="ph codeph">waitFor</samp> function fails to find the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> control that's being
				searched for.</p>

  });

  oLayout.addContent(oButton);

});</pre></div>

			</div><p class="p">Now when you execute the test, you should see a passed verification step:</p>

			</div></div>
<p class="p">Steps 1 and 2 passed because the corresponding step definitions were found in the steps file. Here Gherkin is confirming that it was able

				</p>
<p class="p">Step 4 is failing because you haven't written that step definition yet.</p>
<p class="p">Your next activity would be to write a step definition for
