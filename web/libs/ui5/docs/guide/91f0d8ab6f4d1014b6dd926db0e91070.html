					<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">List binding </span> (or <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">"aggregation
							binding"</span>) can be used to automatically create child controls
						according to model. This can be done either by cloning a template control,

						the OData model. </p>

				<p class="p">The model has a default size limit to avoid too much data being rendered on the UI. This size
					limit determines the number of entries used for the list bindings. The default
					size limit is 100 entries.</p>

				<p class="p">This means that controls that don't support paging or don't request data in
					chunks (e.g. <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.ComboBox</samp>) only show 100 entries even though
					the model contains more items.</p>

				<p class="p">To change this behavior, you can set a size limit in the model by using
						<samp class="ph codeph">oModel.setSizeLimit</samp>. </p>
