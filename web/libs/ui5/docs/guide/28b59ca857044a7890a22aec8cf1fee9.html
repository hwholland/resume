		and the main view of the app (<span class="ph filepath">App.view.xml</span>).</p>

			<p class="p">We recommend that you use the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file to configure the app
				settings and put all important information needed to run the app in there. Using
				this approach means you need to write less application code, and you can already
				access the information before the app is instantiated.</p>

			<p class="p">Some attributes in the descriptor are just for information purposes, such as the minimum <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> version
					(<samp class="ph codeph">minUI5version</samp>), others help external components (for example
				the <span class="ph pname">SAP Fiori launchpad</span>
					(<span class="ph pname">FLP</span>)) to integrate
				the application correctly, but most of the attributes are actually used to configure
				specific aspects of the app that are needed frequently.</p>

			<div class="p">The most important configuration settings are:<ul class="ul" id="loio28b59ca857044a7890a22aec8cf1fee9__ul_x3w_dds_ft">

						<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Models</span>. Examples of models are the configuration of the OData service
							(default model) and language files (i18n model). All models described in
							the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file are automatically
							instantiated when the app is started. </p>

			<p class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">App.view.xml</span> file defines the root view of the app. In most cases, it
				contains an <samp class="ph codeph">App</samp> control or a <samp class="ph codeph">SplitApp</samp> control as a
				root control.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> supports multiple view
				types (XML, HTML, JavaScript, JSON). We recommend using XML views, as for these you
				have to separate the controller logic from the view definition in a controller file
				(for example <span class="ph filepath">App.controller.js</span>). </p>

			<p class="p">We also recommend creating a separate view file for each view you want to use in your app.</p>

			<div class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">Component.js</span> file holds the app setup. The

				component is instantiated.<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
					<p class="p">Your component extends <samp class="ph codeph">UIComponent</samp>. If you are overriding the init function
						of your component, you have to make sure that you call the

						initialize the router afterwards.</p>

				</div>
In the metadata section of the component, you define a reference to the
				descriptor file. When the component is instantiated, the descriptor is loaded and
				parsed automatically.</div>

						<p class="p">This app cannot be run standalone, meaning no <span class="ph filepath">index.html</span> file is
