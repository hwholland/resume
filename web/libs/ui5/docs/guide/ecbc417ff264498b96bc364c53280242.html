	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Advanced concepts for components include routing and navigation and component data as
		well as the event bus.</p>

		<p class="p">The following advanced concepts for components exist.</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loioecbc417ff264498b96bc364c53280242__ul_fv1_fpl_kn">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Routing and navigation</p>

				<p class="p">UI components support the routing and navigation concept, see <a class="xref" href="acdb6cd408ec4b9eb5e1fe45e607abdd.html" title="This topic describes how to initialize routing in a component and access the routing functions.">Initializing and Accessing a Routing Instance</a>.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Extensibility and customizing</p>

				<p class="p">The extensibility and customizing concept allows you to extend and modify
					components in order to replace and extend the views and controllers as well as
					to modify the views. A  customization can be performed, for example, on a custom
					application that extends a delivered standard application.</p>

				<p class="p">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="a264a9abf98d4caabbf9b027bc1005d8.html" title="You can adapt an OpenUI5 app to your specific requirements. For example, you can adapt or replace views, extend or replace controllers, or change language-specific texts.">Extending Apps</a></p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Component data</p>

				<p class="p">The JSON object <samp class="ph codeph">ComponentData</samp> contains any initial values of
					parameters that can be used in the <samp class="ph codeph">createComponent()</samp> method.
					Component data are already available for use in the
						<samp class="ph codeph">createComponent()</samp> method, but not the parameters. The
					parameters are available in the <samp class="ph codeph">onBefore</samp>, the
						<samp class="ph codeph">onAfterRendering</samp> and the setter methods of the
					parameters.</p>

				<p class="p">Component data is provided from outside and can be configured as desired.
					Configuration data is static and defined in the component. To change or extend
					the configuration, the component needs to be extended and a new configuration
					has to be created and merged with the configuration in the parent component.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Event bus of the component</p>

				<p class="p">The local event bus belongs to the component and can be used by all children of this
					component. Once a component instance is destroyed, the listeners registered in
					the event bus are destroyed automatically. <span class="ph">For more
						information, see <a class="xref" href="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component/methods/getEventBus" alt="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component/methods/getEventBus" title="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component/methods/getEventBus">API Reference for the
								<samp class="ph codeph">getEventBus</samp> method of
								<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Component</samp></a>.</span>
