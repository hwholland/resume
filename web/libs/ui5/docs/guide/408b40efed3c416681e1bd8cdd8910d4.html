	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">If a web app has performance issues, finding the cause can be both a time-consuming and
		nerve-consuming task. To help you avoid and solve performance issues in your app, here are
		some good practices we've discovered while dealing with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> apps. </p>

		<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> apps are basically
			JavaScript files sent to a client by a server and interpreted by the browser. So it's
			not only the coding of the app that can cause slow performance. It often turns out, for
			example, that the configuration is wrong. Slow networks or servers may also have a heavy
			impact on the performance of a web app. Let's have a look at the most common issues that
			impact performance.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Configuration</div><div type="Configuration"><div class="p">Issues with configuration are often caused by an old
				bootstrap or wrong usage of the activated features. Here's an example of what a
				bootstrap should look like for an up-to-date <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> app:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-html">&lt;script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
	src="<span class="ph">openui5</span>/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
	data-sap-ui-libs="sap.m"
	data-sap-ui-theme="sap_belize"
	data-sap-ui-bindingSyntax="complex"
	data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge"
	<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">data-sap-ui-preload="async"</span>
	data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{
		"your.app": "yourDir/"
}'&gt;</pre></div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
					<p class="p">For more information about bootstrap attributes, see <a class="xref" href="a04b0d10fb494d1cb722b9e341b584ba.html" title="To use OpenUI5 features in your HTML page, you have to load and initialize the SAPUI5 library.">Bootstrapping: Loading and Initializing</a>.</p>

				</div>
</div>
<div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Use asynchronous loading</p>

				<p class="p">The most important setting is <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-preload="async"</samp>. This
					enables the runtime to load the modules for all declared libraries
					asynchronously in the background. This reduces the number of requests sent by
					the client that could block each other.</p>

				<p class="p">Don't forget to implement the asynchronous behavior in the <samp class="ph codeph">init</samp>
					event of the core as well, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>

				<div class="p">
					<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-html">&lt;script&gt;
	sap.ui.getCore().attachInit(function() {
		sap.ui.require(["sap/ui/core/ComponentContainer"], function(ComponentContainer) {

			new ComponentContainer({
				name: "your.component",
				manifest: true,
				height: "100%",
				componentCreated: function(oParams) {
					var oComponent = oParams.getParameter("component");
					// do something with the component instance
				}
			}).placeAt("content");
			
		});
	});
		
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>

				</div>

				<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">async</samp> mode only helps performance if all of the libraries
					that are required initially are specified in the
						<samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-libs</samp> attribute of the bootstrap. If there are
					additional dependencies that are not listed (such as transitive dependencies
					that are inherited from a listed library), <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> can load
					them automatically, but then <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span> has to first
					read the configured libraries and find out about these dependencies, and this
					can take time. This is why we recommend adding these libraries explicitly to the
					bootstrap parameter <samp class="ph codeph">data-sap-ui-libs</samp> to achieve maximum
					parallelism. This recommendation does not apply for apps that have a descriptor
					file. In this case, only direct dependencies should be listed. For more
					information, see <a class="xref" href="be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html" title="The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries is inspired by the Web Application Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.">Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries</a>.</p>

				
			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Use the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> descriptor file instead
					of the bootstrap to define dependencies</p>

				<p class="p">Don't specify a link to the CSS in the bootstrap of your app, use the
						<span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> descriptor file instead.</p>

				<p class="p">You can declare dependencies to libraries and components in the bootstrap of your
					app, but we recommend using the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> application
					descriptor file instead, because this way you can benefit from the preload
					features of the component factory, which shortens the loading times.</p>

				<p class="p">Make sure that you don't load too many dependencies. In most apps, it's enough to
					load the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core</samp> and the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp> library by
					default and add additional libraries only when needed.</p>

				<div class="p">If you want to make additional libraries generally known in your app, without
					directly loading them during the app start, you can add them to the dependency
					declaration in the <span class="ph filepath">manifest.json</span> file with the
						<samp class="ph codeph">lazy</samp> loading option, which makes sure that the libraries
					are only loaded when they are
					needed:<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint lang-json">"sap.ui5": {

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use asynchronous view loading as described here: <a class="xref" href="68d0e58857a647d49470d9f92dd859bd.html" title="To instantiate views, OpenUI5 provides the factory method sap.ui.view.">Instantiating Views</a></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">If you use data binding with an OData service as a back end, you might
							also want to consider switching your OData model to our more updated V2
							OData model. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="6c47b2b39db9404582994070ec3d57a2.html#loio6c47b2b39db9404582994070ec3d57a2" title="The OData V2 Model enables binding of controls to data from OData services.">OData V2 Model</a></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Optimize dependent binding as described here: <a class="xref" href="6c47b2b39db9404582994070ec3d57a2.html#loio62149734b5c24507868e722fe87a75db" title="The ODataModel V2 supports a flag called &#34;preliminaryContext&#34;. With this option set to true, the ODataModel is able to bundle the OData calls for dependent bindings together into fewer $batch requests.">Optimizing Dependent Bindings</a>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use the model preload feature: Components can preload models for which
							modules are already loaded otherwise a warning will be shown. The
							ODataModel V2 benefits especially because the metadata can be loaded in
							parallel during component load. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="26ba6a5c1e5c417f8b21cce1411dba2c.html" title="The preload flag enables a preload mode for a model, thus improving the startup performance of an app or component.">Manifest Model Preload</a>.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Make use of asynchronous module loading (AMD style) for custom controls
							or other scripts. Although it is only supported by the preload, it will
							help you in future to enable asynchronous loading of individual modules
							combined with the usage of HTTP/2 or AMD-based packagers. It also
							ensures proper dependency tracking between modules.</p>

						<p class="p">But it isn't enough to write AMD modules. You also need to prevent access to <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">OpenUI5</span></span>
							classes via global names. Do not use <samp class="ph codeph">new
							sap.m.Button()</samp>, but require the <samp class="ph codeph">Button</samp> and
							call the constructor via the local AMD reference. For more information,
							see the <span class="ph"><a class="xref" href="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.define" alt="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.define" title="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui/methods/sap.ui.define"> API Reference for <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.define</samp></a> in the
								Demo Kit.</span></p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Avoid the usage of <samp class="ph codeph">setTimeout()</samp> calls with values
							greater than <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp>. This usually indicates an anti-pattern
							in application code that is used as a  workaround and should be avoided.
