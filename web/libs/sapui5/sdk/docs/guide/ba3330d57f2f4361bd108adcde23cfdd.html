		drill-down application that you navigate to when you click the KPI or OPI tile in the
		runtime environment. </p>
<div class="p">There are several different kinds of chart available and you can configure aspects such
			as the color, how the data is sorted, and whether data from associated KPIs should be
			displayed. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> You do not need to activate a drill-down configuration. Each time you

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Configure the Facet Filter</div><div type="Configure the Facet Filter">
			
			<p class="p">The facet filter allows the SAP Smart Business user to filter the information shown on the
				screen at runtime. The user can filter based on any of the dimensions present in the
				entity set of the virtual data model (VDM) in the backend. At runtime, the user can
				also either choose to have all values of a specific dimension or restrict the data
				set to specified values of the dimension.</p>

			<p class="p">A change in filter values triggers a refresh of the KPI aggregate value, the mini
				charts, and the view currently being displayed. The data is displayed with the
				filter values applied. Mini charts for which the filter dimensions are not suitable
				are not displayed.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Depending on the number of mini charts displayed, performance issues may arise due
				to the additional backend calls that are required to refresh each tile whenever
				filter values are changed.</div>

			<p class="p">Using the <span class="ph pname">Configure KPI Drill-Down</span> app, at design time you can choose the
				default dimensions that appear in the facet filter bar at runtime; however you
				cannot pre-select default values for each of the dimensions.</p>

			<div class="p">At runtime, the SAP Smart Business user can carry out the following adjustments to
				the facet filter:<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_dbr_rv4_n4"><li class="li">Toggle the visibility of the facet filter bar.</li>
<li class="li">Reset the applied filter values to <span class="ph uicontrol">All</span> for all of the dimensions
						currently added to the filter bar.</li>
<li class="li">Add any of the remaining dimensions present in the VDM to the facet filter bar, or hide
						dimensions that are currently visible.</li>
</ul>

				<ol class="ol" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ol_m45_wv4_n4"><li class="li">The values listed for each dimension of the facet filter are only retrieved
						from the backend when you click the dimension.</li>
<li class="li">When multiple filters are applied, each of the filters is not applied
						separately but together with the other specified filters. That is, the
						system filters on the following basis: <ol class="ol" type="a" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ol_v24_1w4_n4"><li class="li">Filter1 = Value1 and Filter 2 = Value 2 <p class="p">and not</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Filter1 = Value 1 or Filter 2 = Value 2<p class="p">Also, every time a filter value is specified,
									the filter values for the rest of the dimensions are refreshed
									based on the currently selected filter values as in the
									following example:</p>

								<p class="p">You have selected 3 dimensions for the filter bar: Filter 1 (all
									countries where a company has manufacturing plants), Filter 2
									(all cities where a company has manufacturing plants), and
									Filter 3 (all heads of the manufacturing plants).</p>
<p class="p">At
									runtime, if the user clicks a country in Filter 1, only the
									cities within that country are used to populate the value list
									for Filter 2 and only the manufacturing plants within that
									country are used to populate the value list for Filter 3. The
									values within Filter 2 and Filter 3 are only updated when the
									user clicks the respective filters.</p>
<p class="p">If nothing is selected
									in any of the filters and the user chooses a city in Filter 2,
									the values of Filter 1 and Filter 3 are filtered based on the
									selected city. If the user now selects a user in Filter 3, then
									the values within Filter 1 and Filter 2 are again refreshed
									based on the Filter 3 selection. That is, only countries that
									represent the chosen cities (Filter 2) and countries that have
									manufacturing plants headed by the chosen individual (Filter 3)
									are displayed in the Filter 1 value list.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Show or Hide the KPI Aggregate Value</div><div type="Show or Hide the KPI Aggregate Value">
			
			<p class="p">You can choose to either to show or hide the KPI aggregate value at runtime. If you choose to
				show the KPI aggregate value, this value refreshes each time the facet filter value
				is refreshed. The unit of measure (UoM) of the KPI’s main measure is also shown,
				together with the KPI aggregate value, if it is maintained in the VDM and also

				evaluations related to the current evaluation for which the drill-down is
				configured. This includes the current KPI’s other evaluations, as well as all
				evaluations of the KPIs associated with the current KPI.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> If the SAP Smart Business user applies a value filter for any of the dimensions,

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Copy Drill-Down Configurations to other Evaluations</div><div type="Copy Drill-Down Configurations to other Evaluations">
			
			<div class="p">You can copy drill-down configurations configured for one evaluation and paste them to another
				evaluation. All the filter configurations, KPI mini charts, and views are copied if
				they are applicable. The conditions that determine whether it is possible to apply
				the copy-paste are as follows:<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_t41_1gf_dp"><li class="li">The copy is applicable only if the measures and dimensions that make up the

						evaluation.</li>
<li class="li">The mini charts are copied only if the source and target evaluation are from
						the same KPI (in this case, only the mini charts of the parent KPI are
						copied, the mini charts of the associated KPIs are ignored).</li>
</ul>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> When you click <span class="ph uicontrol">Copy</span>, paste is only enabled if the

</div>

			<p class="p">A drill-down configuration can consist of many views in either the chart or table format. You
				can reorganize the views and edit or delete them as required. You can make the

						click the Gear icon beside the individual dimension or measure.</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_ozz_jkp_n4"><li class="li">Sort Order<p class="p">You can choose to define the sort order for each measure or dimension and also
						define the measure or dimension that is used for sorting. By default, the
						measure or dimension that is used for sorting is the same measure or
						dimension for which the sort order is being configured. The order of sorting
						of measures or dimensions will be in the same sequence as the order of
						measures or dimensions saved at design time. For example, Measure 1 is
						sorted in ascending order and Measure 2 in descending order. If Measure 1 is
						listed above Measure 2 at design time, then at runtime the data is first
						sorted on Measure 1 (ascending order) and then on Measure 2 (in descending
						order).</p>
<p class="p">At design time, the working of the sort order can be checked
						only with runtime data and not with dummy data.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Color<p class="p">You can choose how a measure or dimension is colored in runtime. If you

						the Gear icon beside the visualization type.</p>
<p class="p">Other chart settings in
						this section such as configuring the axis, the values, and the color scheme
						will be disabled in cases where they are not relevant for the selected chart
						type. The other settings possible in this section are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loioba3330d57f2f4361bd108adcde23cfdd__ul_jhk_3jm_kr"><li class="li">Configure a Single or a Dual Axis<p class="p">This is applicable only to bar or column charts. In a
								dual axis chart, only two bars or columns are present, therefore all
								measures must either be part of the first bar or column (Stack 1) or
								second bar or column (Stack 2). Dimension stacking is not possible
								in a dual axis chart.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure Absolute or Percentage Values<p class="p">Absolute value charts display
								the exact value in the graph. Percentage value graphs display the
								scale of the axis from 0 to 100 and all measures are stacked.
								Dimension staking is not possible here, and the sum of the
								percentage values of all the bars or columns for each dimension in
								always 100. In a percentage value chart, the value inside the bar or
								column represents the absolute value. Only the axis values are in
								percentage basis.</p>

<p class="p">The navigation links are either
