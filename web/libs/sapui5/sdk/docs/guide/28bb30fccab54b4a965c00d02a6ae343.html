<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Key Features</div><div type="Key Features">
			
			<p class="p">The following SAP Smart Business modeler apps are available:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_lct_2jj_n4"><li class="li">Create KPI<p class="p">You use this app to create key performance indicators (KPIs) or
						operational performance indicators (OPIs). KPIs identify and measure the key
						metrics of a business. OPIs are similar to KPIs in that both measure the
						metrics of an aspect of a business. But while a KPI looks at broad
						categories (for example, car sales in a particular country or region), an
						OPI measures a specific process or operation - typically one at a bottleneck
						for a business. For example, an OPI for a shipping company would look at
						orders shipped on time. You can save KPIs or OPIs in an intermediate state
						if the complete information is not yet available (for more information, see
							<a class="xref" href="2ee2365cbbdc405bad32401fee1a9fbb.html">Create KPI</a> under
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Related Links</span> in this document). For more
						information about statuses, see section <span class="ph uicontrol">SAP Smart Business Entity
							Statuses</span> in this document.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create Evaluation<p class="p">You create an evaluation to define a specific representation
						of a KPI or OPI, which means that you define a certain selection of the KPI
						data, the targets and thresholds that are relevant, together with some
						additional information. For example, you have defined a KPI to monitor car
						sales in a particular country. You can then create an evaluation that
						restricts the results to a certain area of that country for which one sales
						representative is responsible.</p>
<p class="p">You must specify an active KPI or OPI
						when you are creating an evaluation. The KPI data is copied to the
						evaluation as a proposal but you can overwrite it later.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Manage KPI Authorizations<p class="p">You use this app to authorize users or user roles
						for evaluations. An SAP Smart Business user can only see an evaluation, its
						tiles, and its drill-down views at runtime when you assign the user or role
						to the evaluation using this app and when you have activated all
						entities.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> An entity that you create using the SAP Smart Business
						modeler apps is not automatically visible to you when you logon to the
						runtime environment unless you have been authorized for the related
						evaluation.</div>
</li>
<li class="li">Configure KPI Tiles<p class="p">With this app, you configure tiles for active evaluations
						as the starting point for further analysis of a KPI or and OPI. At runtime,
						you click the KPI or OPI tile to open either an SAP Smart Business generic
						drill-down application or another type of specified analysis screen (for
						example, SAP Lumira). You can choose how to visualize the tile by selecting
						one of the available tile types (numeric, comparison, trend, or actual vs.
						target).</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_dx5_mlj_n4"><li class="li">Configure KPI Drill-Down<p class="p">You use this app to configure different views,
						charts, filters, and associated KPIs for an active evaluation. You configure
						the drill-down so that you can analyze the KPI or OPI in further detail at
						runtime. </p>
</li>
<li class="li">Manage KPI Associations<p class="p">This app allows you to define a relationship between
						active KPIs. You can choose to define either a supporting or a conflicting
						association depending on the relationship between the two KPIs. Supporting
						associations apply when the two KPIs influence each other in a positive way,
						for example, the net advertisement cost and the cost of manufacturing for
						goods contribute to the cost of goods sold KPI. Conflicting associations
						apply when two KPIs influence each other in a negative way, for example, the
						net sales and net cost KPIs are associated in a conflicting way to provide a
						value for the net revenue KPI.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Delete Personalized KPI Tiles<p class="p">You use this app to delete KPI tiles created using the
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Save as Tile</span> feature in the generic drill-down
						app.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">KPI Workspace<p class="p">The KPI Workspace app allows you to access all of your KPIs or
						OPIs in one place. You can activate, edit, delete, or duplicate a KPI or OPI
						as well as add them to your favorites.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Migration Tool<p class="p">Former versions of SAP Smart Business used a different architecture. You
						can use the migration tool app to migrate old KPIs and related entities to
						the latest version of SAP Smart Business, which offers improved usability
						and a newly designed user interface.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
						<p class="p">The IDs of the Smart Business entities are no longer displayed by
							default. Also, users have to no longer enter the entity IDs. They are
							now automatically generated by the framework. However, users can change
							these auto generated IDs. To do this, users have to first choose Make ID
							Visible in the Fiori Launchpad user settings. Any change to this ID
							visibility setting is persisted for the user in all sessions and across
							all the modeler apps.</p>

						<p class="p">The ID of an entity can be edited only until the first instance of save
							operation.</p>

						<p class="p">The search operation now works on entity title and tags instead of the
							entity ID field.</p>

					</div>
</li>
</ul>

			<div class="p">In addition to the modeler apps, a download tool is also available. You can use the SAP Smart
				Business Dowload Tool to copy SAP Smart Business content, such as KPIs, evaluations,
				and drill-downs, from one SAP system to another. This tool allows you to download
				SAP Smart Business contents to the file system of the device on which the tool is
				run. The content is downloaded as a set of csv files and one hdbti file. You can
				then upload these downloaded files to the HANA repository of the target SAP
					system.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> You can this tool only to download content from a SAP system. You
					cannot use this tool to upload content to a SAP system.</div>
</div>

			<p class="p">You can also use this tool to download analytical privileges and roles. To do this,
				you create an empty role and assign all the required evaluations to it. This empty
				role is then provided to the download tool, which in turn generates a set of
				analyticalprivilege files and one hdbrole file. These files can then be uploaded to
				the HANA repository of the target SAP system.</p>

			<p class="p">Based on the release, you can use one of the following URLs to launch the download
				tool:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio28bb30fccab54b4a965c00d02a6ae343__ul_qw1_fbm_kr"><li class="li">For Q2/2015 and later releases, use
						<span class="ph filepath">&lt;HANA_Server&gt;:&lt;HANA_PORT&gt;/sap/hba/r/sb/transp/WebContent/index.html</span></li>
<li class="li">For all releases between Q3/2014 and Q1/2015, use
						<span class="ph filepath">&lt;HANA_Server&gt;:&lt;HANA_PORT&gt;/sap/hba/r/sb/transp/WebContent/index1.html</span></li>
<li class="li">For Q2/2014 and earlier releases, use
						<span class="ph filepath">&lt;HANA_Server&gt;:&lt;HANA_PORT&gt;/sap/hba/apps/kpi/transp/WebContent/index.html</span></li>
</ul>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">You cannot download Smart Business associations using this tool. The associations
					have to be manually created again in the target SAP system.</p>

				<p class="p">For Q2/2014 and earlier releases, the text that you enter while downloading the
					Smart Business content will be used to fetch all the entities whose IDs start
					with the entered text.</p>

				<p class="p">For Q3/2014 and later releases, when selecting the KPIs, the search text that you
					enter will be used to fetch all the KPIs whose titles match the entered
					text.</p>

			</div>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Interaction Between SAP Smart Business Modeler Apps</div><div type="Interaction Between SAP Smart Business Modeler Apps">
			
			<p class="p">KPIs and OPIs are the central entities of SAP Smart Business. You can create KPIs and OPIs
				using the Create KPI app. Based on this KPI or OPI, you can then create an
				evaluation using the Create Evaluation app.</p>

			<p class="p">When you have created an evaluation, you must choose a tile to visualize the KPI or OPI using
				the Configure KPI Tiles app. This lets you define how the tile appears in the
				runtime environment (for example, the SAP Fiori Launchpad). You must then define
				what happens when the SAP Smart Business user clicks the KPI or OPI tile at runtime.
				You define this using the Configure KPI Drill-Down app.</p>

			<p class="p">If required, you can define associations between KPIs using the Manage KPI
					Associations app. You can add associated KPIs to a KPI’s drill-down
				where they are displayed in the header area in the form of KPI mini charts. Finally,
				you must define which user or user role can access the evaluation and related
				entities at runtime. You do this using the Manage KPI Authorizations
				app.</p>

			<p class="p">You can manage all KPIs, OPIs, and evaluations that are available in the system through the
					KPI Workspace app. If you have used previous versions of SAP
				Smart Business, you can migrate your existing KPIs and related entities to the new
				SAP Smart Business version using the Migration Tool app.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">SAP Smart Business Modeler App Users</div><div type="SAP Smart Business Modeler App Users">
			
			<p class="p">The SAP Fiori Launchpad enables you to find and retain the modeler apps required to
				carry out your work (for example, by using role-based allocation of default apps and
				app groups and personalization to add or remove additional apps from a global
				catalog).</p>

			<p class="p">To create new KPIs, you must understand related KPIs from the same and from different
				business areas. You must also be aware of the implications from a business
				perspective of introducing the new KPI. Therefore, the Create KPI and
				the Manage KPI Associations apps are used principally by data
				analysts or operations office employees. In addition, technical knowledge and
				alignment with development teams that build <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> views is required to link a KPI
				to a data source and provide the required input parameters. </p>

			<p class="p">IT administrative knowledge is required to authorize users and roles for evaluations
				and to define navigation targets for KPI tiles. Therefore, the Manage KPI
					Authorizations, Create Evaluation, and Configure
					KPI Tiles apps are used principally by IT personnel.</p>

			<p class="p">Business knowledge is required to configure the drill-down views correctly and as a
				result the Configure KPI Drill-Down app is used mainly by data
				analysts and power users that are close to business users who benefit from and use
				the drill-down views at runtime. </p>

			<p class="p">All user groups benefit from the versatility that the KPI Workspace
				app provides to search and browse through the KPI repository.</p>
