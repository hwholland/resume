		preview of content from an application for which they have the proper
		authorization.</p>

		<p class="p">An overview page provides a wide overview to the end user so that they can look at and interact
			with business data in a specific domain. A user can perform key actions such as clicking
			on a particular card and navigating to another application. But what if the user does an
			intent-based navigation to another application and gets an error because they're not
			authorized to access that application? </p>

		<p class="p">To improve this user experience, during card configuration, you can add  the property
				<samp class="ph codeph">requireAppAuthorization</samp> in the <span class="ph uicontrol">manifest.json</span>
			file. Once a user has entered an app, this property is checked against
				<samp class="ph codeph">isIntentSupported</samp> to see if the user has the required
			authorizations to access the app. If so, then the card will be displayed. The advantage
			here is that the intent could be set explicitly and only if it's required for this card,
			it will work for cards that don't have an intent within its annotation.</p>

		<p class="p">Also, <samp class="ph codeph">isIntentSupported</samp> is standard functionality in the Cross Application
			Navigation Service. </p>
