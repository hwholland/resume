			<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is a client UI
				technology based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. </p>

			<p class="p">Apps developed with <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> run in a browser on any device (mobile, tablet or desktop PC). </p>

			<p class="p">When users access an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> app, a request
				is sent to the respective server to load the application into the browser. The view
				accesses the relevant libraries. Usually the model is also instantiated and business
				data is fetched from the database.</p>

			<p class="p">Depending on the environment in which <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> is used, the
				libraries or your applications can be stored, for example, on an <span class="ph pname">SAP NetWeaver Application
                            Server</span> or an <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, and business
				data can be accessed, for example, using the OData model through a <span class="ph pname">SAP Gateway</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">The top-level structural unit is called a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">library</span>. Libraries are the master artifacts in the extensibility concept. They
				bundle a set of controls and related types and make them consumable by Web applications. There are predefined and standard libraries, like
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m</samp>, with many commonly used controls. At the same time, it treats custom UI libraries as first-class citizens, making it
				easy for you to write and use your own controls alongside the predefined ones.</p>

			<p class="p">A UI <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">element</span> is the basic building block of our user interfaces; it is a reusable entity with properties, events, methods,
				and relations. The most important relations are aggregations to other UI elements, and in this way a tree structure of elements can be
				created.</p>

			<p class="p">From a developer's point of view, a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">control</span> (e.g. <samp class="ph codeph">Button</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">Label</samp>,
					<samp class="ph codeph">TextField</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">Table</samp>) is the most important artifact. It is an object which controls the appearance and
				user interaction of a rectangular screen region. It is a special kind of user interface element which can be used as the root of such a tree
				structure. In this way, it serves as an entry point, especially for rendering. Besides controls, there are also other <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">non-control
					elements</span>, which cannot be used as the root of such a tree structure, but only as a dependent part within it (e.g.
					<samp class="ph codeph">TableRow</samp>, <samp class="ph codeph">TableCell</samp>).</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Data types</span> are first-class entities in the meta model. This allows reuse of types across libraries and extensibility of the
				type system. The core library (technically, this is the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core</samp> library) already defines a core set of types that can be
				used in other libraries.</p>
