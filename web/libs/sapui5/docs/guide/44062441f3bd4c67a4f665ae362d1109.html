}</pre></div>

			<p class="p">In the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.app</samp> section of the descriptor file, we add a data source
				configuration. With the <samp class="ph codeph">invoiceRemote</samp>, key we specify a
				configuration object that allows automatic model instantiation. We specify the type
				of the service (<samp class="ph codeph">OData</samp>) and the model version
				(<samp class="ph codeph">2.0</samp>). In this step, we want to use the publicly available
				Northwind OData service located at
					<span class="ph filepath">https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/</span>.
				Therefore, the URI points to the official Northwind OData service.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">We are referencing the Northwind OData service via HTTPS. However, the
					certificate might not be trusted. Thus, make sure that you call the URL
						<span class="ph filepath">https://services.odata.org/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/</span>
					directly in your browser and accept the certificate once, before you
					continue.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">In the <samp class="ph codeph">models</samp> section, we replace the content of the
					<samp class="ph codeph">invoice</samp> model. This key is still used as model name when the
				model is automatically instantiated during the component initialization. However,
				the <samp class="ph codeph">invoiceRemote</samp> value of the <samp class="ph codeph">dataSource</samp> key is a
				reference to the data source section that we specified above. This configuration
				allows the component to retrieve the technical information for this model during the
				start-up of the app.</p>

			<p class="p">Our component now automatically creates an instance of
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel</samp> according to the settings we
				specified above, and makes it available as model named <samp class="ph codeph">invoice</samp>. If
				you want to have a default model on the component, you can change the name of the
				model to an empty string in the descriptor file. Automatically instantiated models
				can be retrieved by calling <samp class="ph codeph">this.getModel</samp> in the component. In the
				controllers of component-based apps you can call
					<samp class="ph codeph">this.getView().getModel()</samp> to get the automatically instantiated
				model. For retrieving a named model you have to pass on the model name defined in
				the descriptor file to <samp class="ph codeph">getModel</samp>, this means, in the component you
				would call <samp class="ph codeph">this.getModel("invoice")</samp> to get our automatically
				generated <samp class="ph codeph">invoice</samp> model that we defined in the descriptor. </p>

			<p class="p">When using the data source <samp class="ph codeph">invoiceRemote</samp>, the
					<samp class="ph codeph">ODataModel</samp> fetches the data from the real Northwind OData
				service. The invoices we receive from the Northwind OData service have identical
				properties as the JSON data we used previously (except for the
					<samp class="ph codeph">status</samp> propertythat is not available in the Northwind OData
				service).</p>

			<p class="p">You can now try to run the app and see what happens - we will see some errors in the
				browser’s console:</p>

			<div class="fig fignone" id="loio44062441f3bd4c67a4f665ae362d1109__fig_jyf_f1k_c5"><div class="figcontainer">
				
				<img class="image" id="loio44062441f3bd4c67a4f665ae362d1109__image_lmw_d1k_c5" src="loio2c36d72282e34903a97197783fe92122_HiRes.png"/>
			<div class="figcap">Violations of the same-origin policy in Google Chrome</div></div></div>

			<p class="p">Due to the so called same-origin policy, browsers deny AJAX requests to service
				endpoints in case the domain/subdomain, protocol, or port differ from the app’s
				domain/subdomain, protocol, or port.</p>

			<p class="p">The browser refuses to connect to a remote URL directly for security reasons and we
				need a workaround:</p>

			<p class="p">In Google Chrome, you can easily disable same-origin policy of Chrome by running Chrome with
				the following command:
					<samp class="ph codeph">[here-your-path-to-chrome-installation-dir]\chrome.exe
					--disable-web-security --user-data-dir</samp>. Make sure that all instances of
				Chrome are closed before you run the command above. This will allow all web sites to
				break out of the same-origin policy and connect to the remote service directly. </p>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Be aware that it’s a security risk in case you run Chrome this way for
						surfing on the internet.</span> However, it also allows you to avoid the
					need of setting up a proxy at development time or for testing purposes.</p>

				<p class="p">For productive apps this approach is therefore not recommended. If you have the
					same issue in a productive app, check <a class="xref" href="5bb388fc289d44dca886c8fa25da466e.html">Request Fails Due to Same-Origin Policy (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS))</a> in the <a class="xref" href="dfe4f79843c44c40b3fb95ebffb65646.html" title="This section contains the most common issues that you might face when developing SAPUI5 apps and how to solve them.">First-Aid Kit</a>.</p>

				<p class="p">If you are using the <span class="ph pname">SAP Web IDE</span>, you can configure
					a destination to your service and use a relative path in your app, for example
						<samp class="ph codeph">"uri":
						"/destinations/northwind/V2/Northwind/Northwind.svc/"</samp>. For more
					information, see <a class="xref" href="3a16c7a2f1e944deb000db49e5ece6be.html" title="Configure a destination in the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit in order to bypass the same-origin policy of the browser.">Create a Northwind Destination</a>.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">After disabling the same-origin policy in your browser, you can now run the app
				again. This time you can see all kinds of invoices retrieved from a real back end.
				In case you still have issues, just continue with the next step. There, we will
				switch to local mock data.</p>
