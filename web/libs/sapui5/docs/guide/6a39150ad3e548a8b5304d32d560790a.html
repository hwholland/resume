	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The API for developers of extensions for SAP Fiori elements provides the
			<samp class="ph codeph">securedExecution</samp> method that can be used for various purposes. </p>

		<p class="p">Use the <samp class="ph codeph">securedExecution</samp> method whenever one of the following operations
			should be performed by extension coding:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio6a39150ad3e548a8b5304d32d560790a__ul_vrj_ykr_w1b">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">An asynchronous operation</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">An operation that needs to be synchronized with other operations that are potentially
					triggered by the user</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">An operation that could result in losing the data entered by the user. Note that this is only
					relevant in non-draft scenarios.</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Displaying custom messages to the user, as described in <a class="xref" href="5a9a2a0f2c054b9686acb3497ba32ae2.html" title="You can use the securedExecution method from the API for developers of template extensions to add and display custom messages.">Adding Custom Messages</a>.</p>

			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">The function that is to be executed must be encapsulated in a <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp>
			function. In most use cases, the operation performed by this method is executed
			asynchronously. Therefore, <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp> is to return a
				<samp class="ph codeph">Promise</samp> that indicates that the operation has finished.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp> must not perform any user interactions.</div>

		<p class="p">Depending on the state of the user interaction, <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp> may or may not be
			executed. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp> is not executed if a user has entered
			data before the operation starts. The user cancels the operation in the dataloss
			confirmation dialog and would lose the entered data. Note that the
				<samp class="ph codeph">securedExecution</samp> method also returns a <samp class="ph codeph">Promise</samp>.
			This <samp class="ph codeph">Promise</samp> is rejected if <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp> is not executed
			for any reason. If <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp> is executed, the <samp class="ph codeph">Promise</samp>
			returned by <samp class="ph codeph">securedExecution</samp> behaves like the <samp class="ph codeph">Promise</samp>
			returned by <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp>.</p>

		<p class="p">As a consequence, if you need data to be returned by <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp>, you should
			pass this data to the <samp class="ph codeph">Promise</samp> returned by
			<samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp>.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> In most cases, it is not necessary to return data from within <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp>,
			since you can also perform the evaluation in <samp class="ph codeph">fnFunction</samp>. However, if
			the code that handles this data is used for a user interaction, this is not possible due
			to the restriction explained above.</div>
