		<p class="p">The original app displays the fields <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> and
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Type</span>.</p>

		<p class="p">Using <span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span> flexibility services,
			customer 1 adds the additional field <span class="ph uicontrol">Info</span> and customer 2 renames
			the existing field <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> to <span class="ph uicontrol">Car</span>. After
			the app was shipped to the customers, SAP changes <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> to
				<span class="ph uicontrol">Automobile</span> in the original app.</p>

		<p class="p">Applying the changes based on the layering concept, the customers would now get the
			following:</p>

		<div class="p">
			<ul class="ul" id="loio17d2d4e8f9f3416da8865c1032f3dc19__ul_vyn_3nv_m1b">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">In the app of customer 1, <span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> would be replaced by
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Automobile</span>. The <span class="ph uicontrol">Info</span> field
						added by the customer would also be applied.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">In the app of customer 2, the change made by SAP (<span class="ph uicontrol">Vehicle</span> renamed to
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Automobile</span>) would not be applied. Reason:
						customer 2 renamed this field to <span class="ph uicontrol">Car</span> and changes made
						by customers overrule changes made by SAP.</p>

				</li>
