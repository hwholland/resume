		<p class="p">This section explains how an administrator or a user can delete personal data in SAP
			Business Suite powered by SAP HANA.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio36dfc53c777647f18c3e6ff097790163__section_ix1_fbm_xz"><div class="section_title">Deleting Analysis Paths</div><div type="Deleting Analysis Paths"><p class="p">When you create an
				analysis path using an APF-based app, the path as well as the user who created the
				path are stored in a SAP HANA database table. </p>
<div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Deletion by an Administrator</p>

				<p class="p">When a user does not have access to the system any longer, for example, because
					he or she left the company, an administrator can delete the user's analysis
					paths. The analysis paths are stored in the following HANA database table:</p>

				<p class="p">Table name: <samp class="ph codeph">"sap.hba.apps.reuse.apf.s.db::ANALYSIS_PATH"</samp></p>

				<p class="p">Schema name: <samp class="ph codeph">"SAP_HBA". The user is stored in the table field "CREATED_BY_USER"</samp></p>

				<p class="p">The administrator can delete the analysis paths with an SQL statement such as the
					following:</p>

				<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">delete from "SAP_HBA"."sap.hba.apps.reuse.apf.s.db::ANALYSIS_PATH" where
						"CREATED_BY_USER" = '&lt;user name&gt;'</samp></p>

			</div><div class="sectiondiv subsection">
				<p class="p subsectiontitle">Deletion by a User</p>

				<p class="p">Users who still have system access can delete their own saved analysis paths directly in the
					analysis path gallery of the runtime application. To do so, open the analysis
					path menu and choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>. This opens a list of all
					saved analysis paths, which can be deleted individually. Repeat this for each
					APF-based application since you can see only those analysis paths that were
					created in the application you're currently using.</p>

		<div class="section" id="loio36dfc53c777647f18c3e6ff097790163__section_dtm_zcm_xz"><div class="section_title">Personal Data in Analysis Paths</div><div type="Personal Data in Analysis Paths">
			
			<p class="p">In an APF-based application, personal data can also appear in an analysis path, for
				example, as a measure in an analysis step such as ‘revenue by consultant’. APF does
				not persist these measures, but only filter criteria that are relevant for
				selections made in a chart. When a user is deleted from the system, the personal
				data of this user is not displayed any longer in an analysis path. The filter
				criteria is also removed from the analysis path so that no personal data of the
				deleted user shows up.</p>
