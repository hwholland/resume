			<Text text="As the founder of Holland Systems, I had to wear many hats for quite a while. Some of these responsibilities included setting up our financial system, designing our business operations, recruiting, managing our employees, sales, account management, and pretending like I knew how to run a business. However, over 80% of my time was spent consulting. I served as an Enterprise Architect, Solution Architect, Systems Architect, EIM Architect, SAP PI/EDI Developer, SAP MDM Developer, SAP Security Engineer and possibly a few other things as well."/>
