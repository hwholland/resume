			<Text text="Wolseley was doing an SAP implementation (at the time, it was SAP's largest new account) and was building their internal competency in various technical skillsets.  I was brought on because I had previous experience on the basis side of the house, but also had some hands on experience with integration using IDocs and SAP PI.  During my time there, I took on as much technical work as I could and ultimately learned SAP MDM at a time when not very many people knew the product."/>
