			<Text text="I was the first person that DataXstream hired when the two founders decided to grow their business.  I learned everything I could about the technology used in SAP projects and helped as a consultant on some of their projects after my skills had developed.  I performed a system copy of SAP 4.6c, configured interfaces using SAP ALE and IDocs between SAP and non-SAP systems, and performed basic mapping with SAP PI.  I installed SAP XI 2.0, which at the time was poorly documented and had several major installation bugs that I had to work through on my own.  Most of my learning was self-taught, but I had a great furtune of being able to ask questions to some of the most experienced consultants in the game.  This company has since grown into a successful consulting business, and I have worked with them on several occasions as an independent."/>
