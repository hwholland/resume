			<Text text="Mylan had a global SAP implementation which included Master Data Management for the finance domains.  I was responsible for all of the design, build, and support of the MDM solution.

My responsibilities also included the facilitation of the integration development and testing - which included development in SAP PI and configuration of the ALE layer in SAP.  Additionally, I was responsible for the development of the security and governance model, including the development of security roles in several SAP products."/>

			<Text text="On this project I was sub-contracted by the lead implementer and represented their company, however their entire team was based in Zurich so I was the only resource in the United States where much of the decision making (from the customer side) took place.  Therefore, my role also incorporated a lot of customer relationship management and general project management activities. "/>
