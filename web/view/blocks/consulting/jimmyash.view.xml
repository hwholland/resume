			<Text text="JimmyAsh is a disruptive startup with a proprietary manufacturing process enabling them to produce significantly healthier snack foods.  They had secured contracts with several large customers long before a production run of their factory, and therefore were in a uniquely challenging position.  They needed to meet the demands of Fortune 1000 customers but with the staff and funding of a typical startup.  My company became their IT partner assisting with evaluation and purchasing of IT equipment, negotiating and coordinating with other IT vendors (such as telecom), physically networking their offices and plants, providing technical support to their end-users, and also evaluating small to mid-sized ERP solutions and negotiating a price and implementation that was a fraction of the cost most would expect."/>
