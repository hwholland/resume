			<Text text="Gerdau Ameristeel was in the middle of a full-scale implementation of SAP when I was brought on to assist with the EDI component of their project.  The work almost exclusively centered around SAP PI development for mappings, but also included ALE/IDoc configuration within SAP ERP, and configuration of the EDI message broker called Crossgate (which was an SAP acquisition that has since been retired).  I personally developed, tested, and supported a large portion of the interfaces including the 404 810, 850, 856, and 997 (among others)."/>
