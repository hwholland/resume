			<Text text="American Greetings had a multi-year SAP initiative and engaged my company for a large portion of the technical work.  The scope of activities were wide, including (but not limited to) Solution Manager configuration of retrofit and ChaRM - with the rollout of an n+1 landscape.  SAP Identity Management was integrated into the HR modules of SAP and IBM's TAM LDAP to seamlessly provision new and modified users throughout the landscape.  SAP MDM was used in conjuction with BusinessObjects Data Services to consolidate, cleanse, and convert legacy data - and serve data to a custom web initiative.  Enterprise Portal was implemented as the unified user-interface / front-end to simplify the management of equipment and helpdesk activitieis.  SAP CE was heavily used for building cross-system workflow processes.  SAP PI was used as the middleware for all interfaces in and out of SAP ERP."/>
