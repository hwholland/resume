			<Text text="LambWeston was performing a carve-out from Conagra as they were performing a split into a distinctly separate legal entity, and needed to be independently free from the IT infrastructure of their former company.  The timeline was very aggressive due to regulatory reasons in which certain dates had to be hit to prevent financial impact.  The project was largely centered around a series of system clone procedures to copy the source ERP systems into a new landscape.  Following this, the database needed to be stripped of any Conagra-sensative information.  Additionally, interfaces (including EDI) had to be rebuilt from the ground up, conversion/load programs had to be developed, some minor modifications made to existing ABAP enhancements, security roles had to be completely redesigned (and integrated with external HR system), and workflows required updating."/>

			<Text text="This was a unique project in that the complexity largely centered around reverse-engineering some rather 'exotic' customizations within the SAP landscape to ensure they would still be operational on the new system.  To further complicate things, there was also a migration to SAP HANA that took place as part of the system clone procedure - further increasing the risk that customizations may not work due to underlying database and architectural platform changes.  Despite a significantly understaffed team (less than 15 experienced resources) and a massively tight timeline, the project went live with a delay of just one week."/>
