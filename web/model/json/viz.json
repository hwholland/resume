I learned everything I could about the technology used in SAP projects and helped as a consultant on some of their projects after my skills had developed. I performed a system copy of SAP 4.6c, configured interfaces using SAP ALE and IDocs between SAP and non-SAP systems, and performed basic mapping with SAP PI. I installed SAP XI 2.0, which at the time was poorly documented and had several major installation bugs that I had to work through on my own. Most of my learning was self-taught, but I had a great furtune of being able to ask questions to some of the most experienced consultants in the game. This company has since grown into a successful consulting business, and I have worked with them on several occasions as an independent.",

This included the security role design and governance structure, process design and implementation via workflow, configuration of web-based views using SAP Enterprise Portal and on occasion some custom views using Java WebDynpro and the MDM Java API, interfaces to multiple systems using SAP PI, and a consolidated data set for the conversion loads into SAP ERP.One of the most interesting parts of this project was the fact that the customer identified gaps in the product which needed to be addressed with SAP Labs, the development side of SAP. We worked together to spec out the missing functionality and were able to roll this into a future release of the product to address the customer's needs. Further, much of the work with Applied Materials gave me a unique insight into the demands of customers, which allowed me to work on a future product of SAP's called MDG.",

The timeline was very aggressive due to regulatory reasons in which certain dates had to be hit to prevent financial impact. The project was largely centered around a series of system clone procedures to copy the source ERP systems into a new landscape. Following this, the database needed to be stripped of any Conagra-sensative information. Additionally, interfaces (including EDI) had to be rebuilt from the ground up, conversion/load programs had to be developed, some minor modifications made to existing ABAP enhancements, security roles had to be completely redesigned (and integrated with external HR system), and workflows required updating.This was a unique project in that the complexity largely centered around reverse-engineering some rather 'exotic' customizations within the SAP landscape to ensure they would still be operational on the new system. To further complicate things, there was also a migration to SAP HANA that took place as part of the system clone procedure - further increasing the risk that customizations may not work due to underlying database and architectural platform changes. Despite a significantly understaffed team (less than 15 experienced resources) and a massively tight timeline, the project went live with a delay of just one week.",
