			<Text text="I started as a technical consultant and received two promotions in two years making me the youngest principal consultant in the company at the time.  My focus areas were SAP Master Data Management (and the surrounding processes and modules), SAP XI/PI and ancilliary technologies leveraged for building interfaces between systems, and various web technologies for designing and building user-interfaces that were abstracted from the backend systems.  During my time there, I also worked closely with SAP Labs on several initiatives and gained insight towards the development process at SAP.  I also mentored junior consultants, and presented seminars at conferences demonstrating innovative ways to use the technology."/>
