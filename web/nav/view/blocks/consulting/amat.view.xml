			<Text text="Applied Materials did a full-scale conversion from Oracle ERP to SAP ERP that included nearly the entire suite of SAP products.  One large component of the project was the data conversion and data management peice.  I was the lead on that part of the project and was able to take them live with SAP MDM, SAP EP, and SAP PI on a solution that allowed them to govern and centrally manage the material, customer, and vendor master data domains.  This included the security role design and governance structure, process design and implementation via workflow, configuration of web-based views using SAP Enterprise Portal and on occasion some custom views using Java WebDynpro and the MDM Java API, interfaces to multiple systems using SAP PI, and a consolidated data set for the conversion loads into SAP ERP."/>

			<Text text="One of the most interesting parts of this project was the fact that the customer identified gaps in the product which needed to be addressed with SAP Labs, the development side of SAP.  We worked together to spec out the missing functionality and were able to roll this into a future release of the product to address the customer's needs.  Further, much of the work with Applied Materials gave me a unique insight into the demands of customers, which allowed me to work on a future product of SAP's called MDG."/>
