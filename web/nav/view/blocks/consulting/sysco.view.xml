			<Text text="Sysco Foods was undergoing a large SAP implementation which had the unique scenario of running an advanced MDM initiative in parallel to their project.  This is to say, they had two parallel MDM projects occuring at the same time, and I was responsible for the first wave.  The objective of this project was to cleanse and consolidate as much of the data across their global operations, wherein every state operation much like a distinct company code."/>

			<Text text="The existing platform was a homegrown legacy system wherein each instance (for each U.S. state) was a completely seperate database that did not have well designed integration architecture.  Therefore, the project was unique from most SAP MDM projects in that it largely focused around harmonizing a legacy landscape rather than integrating with an SAP environment."/>
