Additionally, I was responsible for the development of the security and governance model, including the development of security roles in several SAP products.On this project I was sub-contracted by the lead implementer and represented their company, however their entire team was based in Zurich so I was the only resource in the United States where much of the decision making (from the customer side) took place.
